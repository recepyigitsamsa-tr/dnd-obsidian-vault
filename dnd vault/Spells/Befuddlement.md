## Description

You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw.

On a failed save, the target takes 10d12 damage Psychic damage and can't cast spells or take the {@action Magic|XPHB} action. At the end of every 30 days, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on a success. The effect can also be ended by the Greater Restoration|XPHB spell, Heal|XPHB spell, or Wish|XPHB spell spell.

On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.
