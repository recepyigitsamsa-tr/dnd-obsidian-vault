## Description

You create a pair of grasping hands made from invisible condition forces. Make a spell attack against one creature that you can see within range. On a hit, the creature is restrained condition as the hands crush their throat or bodily equivalent.

If the creature requires air to breathe, it begins to suffocate. A suffocating creature can survive for a number of rounds equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn after those rounds are over, it becomes unconscious condition, and it can't regain hit points until it can breathe again.

A conscious creature restrained condition by the hands can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends on the target.
