## Description

You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 damage thunder damage, as well as 5d6 damage radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked prone condition. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone condition.
