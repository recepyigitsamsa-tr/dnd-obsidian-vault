## Description

A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 damage bludgeoning damage and 4d6 damage cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn the storm's area of effect into {@quickref difficult terrain||3} until the end of your next turn.

### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by {@scaledamage 2d8|4-9|1d8} for each slot level above 4th.
