## Description

This demanding spell transfers {@adventure contamination|DoDk|12} from one creature to another. When you cast this spell, you must first touch either a willing humanoid creature with one or more {@adventure levels of contamination|DoDk|12}, or a former humanoid creature whose current form is the result of a monstrous transformation. You then touch a different willing humanoid creature.

If both creatures touched were willing humanoid creatures, you remove all {@adventure contamination levels|DoDk|12} and mutations from the first creature, then the second creature you touch gains a number of {@adventure contamination levels|DoDk|12} equal to the number of levels removed from the first creature.

If the first creature you touch is a former humanoid who suffered a monstrous {@adventure contamination|DoDk|12}, and the second creature is a willing humanoid creature with a character level or challenge rating equal to or higher than the challenge rating of the transformed creature, you restore the fully contaminated creature to its original form, then the humanoid creature immediately undergoes a monstrous transformation as if it had gained six {@adventure contamination levels|DoDk|12}.

The second creature touched cannot prevent or negate these {@adventure contamination levels|DoDk|12} or an ensuing transformation in any way, or else the spell fails with no effect.
