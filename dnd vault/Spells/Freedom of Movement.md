## Description

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by {@quickref difficult terrain||3}, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed condition or restrained condition.

The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled condition. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target's movement or attacks.
