## Description

You cause psychic energy to erupt at a point within range. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point makes an Intelligence saving throw, taking 8d6 damage Psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

On a failed save, a target also has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it subtracts {@dice 1d6} from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as any Constitution saving throws to maintain {@status Concentration|XPHB}. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
