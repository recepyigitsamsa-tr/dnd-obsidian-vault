## Description

A 20-foot-radius sphere of crushing force forms at a point you can see within range and tugs at the creatures there. Each creature in the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d10 damage force damage and is pulled in a straight line toward the center of the sphere, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible (even if that space is in the air). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.

### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 5d10|4-9|1d10} for each slot level above 4th.
