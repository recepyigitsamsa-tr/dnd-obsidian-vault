## Description

A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 damage fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 8d6|3-9|1d6} for each slot level above 3rd.
