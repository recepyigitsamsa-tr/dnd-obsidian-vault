## Description

When you cast this spell, you gain one {@adventure level of contamination|DoDk|12}. A stroke of eldritch lightning forming a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d6 damage lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within the line's area.

### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 damage for each slot level above 3rd.
