## Description

You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 damage psychic damage and subtract {@dice 1d4} from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

This spell's damage increases by 1d6 damage when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6 damage), 11th level (3d6 damage), and 17th level (4d6 damage).
