## Description

The billowing flames of a dragon blast from your feet, granting you explosive speed. For the duration, your speed increases by 20 feet and moving doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

When you move within 5 feet of a creature or an object that isn't being worn or carried, it takes 1d6 damage fire damage from your trail of heat. A creature or object can take this damage only once during a turn.

### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, increase your speed by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 3rd. The spell deals an additional {@scaledamage 1d6|3-9|1d6} fire damage for each slot level above 3rd.
