## Description

A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll {@dice 6d10}; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious condition creatures and creatures that can't see).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is blinded condition until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional {@scaledice 6d10|1-9|2d10} for each slot level above 1st.
