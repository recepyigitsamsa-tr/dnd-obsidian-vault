## Description

You point at one creature you can see within range, and the single chime of a dolorous bell is audible within 10 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 damage Necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, it instead takes 1d12 damage Necrotic damage.

### At Higher Levels
The damage increases by one die when you reach levels 5 (2d8 damage or 2d12 damage), 11 (3d8 damage or 3d12 damage), and 17 (4d8 damage or 4d12 damage).
