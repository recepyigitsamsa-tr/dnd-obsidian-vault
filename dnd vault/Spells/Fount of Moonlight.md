## Description

A cool light wreathes your body for the duration, emitting {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} in a 20-foot radius and {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} for an additional 20 feet.

Until the spell ends, you have {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to Radiant damage, and your melee attacks deal an extra 2d6 damage Radiant damage on a hit.

In addition, immediately after you take damage from a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the Blinded|XPHB condition condition until the end of your next turn.
