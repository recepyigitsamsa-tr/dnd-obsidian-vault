## Description

Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 damage lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

The spell's damage increases by 1d8 damage when you reach 5th level (2d8 damage), 11th level (3d8 damage), and 17th level (4d8 damage).
