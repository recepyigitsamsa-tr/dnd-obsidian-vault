## Description

You point at a location within range, and a glowing, 1-foot-diameter ball of acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 damage Acid damage and another 5d4 damage Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage only.

### At Higher Levels
The initial damage increases by {@scaledamage 10d4|4-9|2d4} for each spell slot level above 4.
