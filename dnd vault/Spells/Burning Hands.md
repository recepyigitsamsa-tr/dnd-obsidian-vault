## Description

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 damage fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

### At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by {@scaledamage 3d6|1-9|1d6} for each slot level above 1st.
