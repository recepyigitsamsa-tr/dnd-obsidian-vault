## Description

You cast sorcerous energy at one creature or object within range. Make a ranged attack roll against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 damage damage of a type you choose: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Psychic, or Thunder.

If you roll an 8 on a {@dice d8} for this spell, you can roll another {@dice d8}, and add it to the damage. When you cast this spell, the maximum number of these d8s you can add to the spell's damage equals your spellcasting ability modifier.

### At Higher Levels
The damage increases by 1d8 damage when you reach levels 5 (2d8 damage), 11 (3d8 damage), and 17 (4d8 damage).
