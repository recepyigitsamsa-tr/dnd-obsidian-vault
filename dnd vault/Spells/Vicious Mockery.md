## Description

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 damage psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

This spell's damage increases by 1d4 damage when you reach 5th level (2d4 damage), 11th level (3d4 damage), and 17th level (4d4 damage).
