## Description

You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 damage bludgeoning damage and is restrained condition for the spell's duration.

As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained condition target, which must make a Strength saving throw. The target takes 2d6 damage bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

To break out, the restrained condition target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained condition by the hand.

As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained condition target if you do either.
