## Description

You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it takes 1d6 damage poison damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a {@dice d4} for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.

The spell's damage increases by 1d6 damage when you reach 5th level (2d6 damage), 11th level (3d6 damage), and 17th level (4d6 damage).
