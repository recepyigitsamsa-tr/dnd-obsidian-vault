## Description

You call forth a Dragon spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the Draconic Spirit|XPHB stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your {@variantrule Initiative|XPHB} count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the {@action Dodge|XPHB} action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

### At Higher Levels
Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.
