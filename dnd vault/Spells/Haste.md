## Description

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the {@action Attack} (one weapon attack only), {@action Dash}, {@action Disengage}, {@action Hide}, or {@action Use an Object} action.

When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.
