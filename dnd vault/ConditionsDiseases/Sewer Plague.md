# Sewer Plague

## Description

Fouled potions and alchemical waste can give rise to Sewer Plague, which incubates in sewers and refuse heaps and is sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in such areas, including otyughs and rats.

A creature suffers the following effects {@dice 1d4} days after infection:

### Fighting the Contagion

Daily at dawn, an infected creature makes a DC 11 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 Exhaustion|XPHB condition level as its fatigue worsens. On a successful save, the creature's Exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the creature's Exhaustion level is reduced to 0, the contagion ends on the creature.
