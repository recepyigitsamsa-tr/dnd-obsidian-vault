# Shivering Sickness

## Description

Insects native to the jungles and marshes of Chult carry this disease, shivering sickness. The easiest protection against it is a coating of insect-repelling salve on all exposed skin (for the cost of insect repellent, see {@adventure "Buying a Special Item"|ToA|1|Buying a Special Item}.

A giant or humanoid that takes damage from Swarm of Insects||insect swarms or from giant centipede||giant centipedes, giant scorpion||giant scorpions, or giant wasp||giant wasps is exposed to the disease at the end of the encounter. Those who haven't applied insect repellent since their previous long rest are exposed to the disease when they finish a long rest.

A giant or humanoid exposed to the disease must succeed on a DC 11 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or become infected. A creature with natural armor has advantage on the saving throw. It takes {@dice 2d6} hours for symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include blurred vision, disorientation, and a sudden drop in body temperature that causes uncontrollable shivering and chattering of the teeth.

Once symptoms begin, the infected creature regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from a long rest. The infected creature also has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls. At the end of a long rest, an infected creature repeats the saving throw, shaking off the disease on a successful save.
