# Throat Leeches

## Description

Minuscule parasites known as throat leeches infect the water in Chult's forests, swamps, and rivers. Any giant or humanoid that swallows tainted water must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be infested with throat leeches. Immediate symptoms include throat inflammation and shortness of breath. After {@dice 1d6} hours, the infected character gains 1 level of exhaustion condition that can't be removed (except as described below) until the disease is cured. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's exhaustion condition increases by 1 level; on a successful save, the creature's exhaustion condition decreases by 1 level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion condition below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

Explorers can avoid contracting throat leeches by drinking only rainwater or water that's been boiled or magically purified.
