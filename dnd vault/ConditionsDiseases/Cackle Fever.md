# Cackle Fever

## Description

Cheaply made potions and elixirs are sometimes tainted by Cackle Fever, which affects Humanoids only (gnomes are strangely immune). A creature suffers the following effects {@dice 1d4} days after infection:

###

### Fighting the Contagion

At the end of each Long Rest, an infected creature makes a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. After the creature succeeds on three of these saves, the contagion ends on it, and the creature is immune to Cackle Fever for 1 year.

### Spreading the Contagion

Any Humanoid (other than a gnome) that starts its turn within a 10-foot {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} originating from a creature infected with Cackle Fever must succeed on a DC 10 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can't catch the contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours.
