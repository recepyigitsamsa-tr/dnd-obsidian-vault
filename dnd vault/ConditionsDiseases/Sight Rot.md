### Fighting the Contagion

Magic such as a Heal|XPHB spell or Lesser Restoration|XPHB spell spell ends the contagion immediately. A character who is proficient with an Herbalism Kit|XPHB can use it to create one dose of nonmagical ointment, which takes 1 hour. When applied to the eyes of a creature suffering from Sight Rot, the ointment suppresses the contagion on that creature for 24 hours. If the contagion is suppressed in this way for a total of 72 hours (requiring three doses and applications of the ointment), the contagion ends on the creature.

### Spreading the Contagion

Any Humanoid that makes skin contact with a creature infected with Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can't catch the contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours.
