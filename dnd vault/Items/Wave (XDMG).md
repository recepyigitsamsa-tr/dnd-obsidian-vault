## Description

Held in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, Wave is engraved with images of waves, shells, and sea creatures.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you roll a 20 on the {@dice d20} for an attack roll with this weapon, the target takes an extra 21 Necrotic damage.

While holding Wave, you gain the following benefits:

### Aquatic Command

Wave has 3 charges and regains {@dice 1d3} expended charges daily at dawn. While you carry it, you can expend 1 charge to cast Dominate Beast|XPHB spell (save DC 20 Saving Throw) from it on a Beast that has a {@variantrule Swim Speed|XPHB}.

### Globe of Invulnerability

While holding Wave, you can cast the level 9 version of Globe of Invulnerability|XPHB spell from it. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Sentience

Wave is a sentient weapon of Neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and {@sense Darkvision|XPHB} out to 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Aquan.

### Personality

Wave zealously encourages mortals to worship sea gods and has a habit of humming sea chanteys. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to further the weapon's objectives in the world.

### Destroying Wave

Wave can be destroyed only on the island of Thunderforge, where it was forged. The weapon must be melted down by a storm giant|XMM or someone imbued with a storm giant's strength. Destroying Wave angers a god of the sea, who sends powerful agents to attack the island and punish the destroyers.
