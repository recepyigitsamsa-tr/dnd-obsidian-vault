## Description

This dark blue vial allows you to read another's surface thoughts and capture them as thought strands, storing the strands within the vial. As an action, you can activate the vial to target a creature you can see within 10 feet of you to learn its surface thoughts and pull the thoughts learned out of the creature's head as a tangible glowing string of energy known as a thought strand. The strands can be stored in the vial for up to 24 hours or until the vial reaches capacity, in which case the oldest strands dissipate. A creature affected by the vial knows that its thoughts are being probed.

The vial can also store thought strands created by the encode thoughts|ggr spell cantrip. It does not extend the duration of those strands beyond 8 hours, but stored strands do not disappear if you cast encode thoughts|ggr spell again during the duration of the cantrip.

The vial has 3 charges and can store up to 3 thought strands. It regains all its charges daily at dusk.
