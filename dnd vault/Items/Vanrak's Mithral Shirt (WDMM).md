## Description

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.

While you wear this armor, you gain {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 60 feet.
