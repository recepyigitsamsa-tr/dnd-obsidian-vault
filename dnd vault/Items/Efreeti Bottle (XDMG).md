## Description

When you take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to remove the stopper of this painted brass bottle, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of it. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an Efreeti|XMM appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

The first time the bottle is opened, the DM rolls on the following table to determine what happens.
