## Description

You can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot {@variantrule Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cone} that is audible out to 600 feet. Each creature in the {@variantrule Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cone} makes a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 damage Thunder damage and has the Deafened|XPHB condition condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. Glass or crystal objects in the {@variantrule Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cone} that aren't being worn or carried take 10d8 damage Thunder damage.

Each use of the horn's magic has a {@chance 20} chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 damage Force damage to the user and destroys the horn.
