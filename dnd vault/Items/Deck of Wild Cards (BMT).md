## Description

This deck of heavy vellum cards hums with the magic of the Elemental Chaos.

The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (a deck of real-world playing cards can simulate the deck). As an action, you can draw a random card from this deck and throw it to make a ranged spell attack, using Dexterity for the attack roll. The card has a range of 30 feet. On a hit, it deals 1d4 damage slashing damage and imposes a magical effect determined by its suit, as detailed in the Deck of Wild Cards table. The card immediately returns to the deck after it hits or misses a target.
