## Description

The top of this magic quarterstaff is shaped like a spider. It deals an extra 1d6 damage poison damage on a hit when used to make a weapon attack.

### Spells

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can expend the requisite number of charges to cast one of the following spells from the staff: spider climb spell (1 charge) or web spell (2 charges; spell save DC 15 Saving Throw).

The staff regains {@dice 1d6 + 4} expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.
