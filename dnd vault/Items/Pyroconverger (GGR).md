## Description

A Pyroconverger is an Izzet-made flamethrower. It carries a risk of malfunction each time you use it.

As an action, you can cause the Pyroconverger to project fire in a 10-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 damage fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Each time you use the Pyroconverger, roll a {@dice d10} and add the number of times you have used it since your last long rest. If the total is 11 or higher, the Pyroconverger malfunctions: you take 4d6 damage fire damage, and you can't use the Pyroconverger again until you finish a long rest.
