## Description

Several of these spellbooks with gilded pages and silver-plated covers were created during the Age of Arcanum, but only one has been found since the Calamity ended. The book has an infinite number of pages, is three inches thick, eight inches wide, twelve inches long, and weighs three pounds.

### Dormant

Most of the book is blank, but the following spells are recorded in the first pages of the tome: alarm spell, antimagic field spell, Bigby's hand spell, blight spell, charm person spell, confusion spell, control weather spell, create undead spell, detect thoughts spell, enlarge/reduce spell, fear spell, foresight spell, gaseous form spell, glyph of warding spell, legend lore spell, Leomund's tiny hut spell, mass suggestion spell, mislead spell, misty step spell, Mordenkainen's faithful hound spell, prismatic spray spell, ray of enfeeblement spell, silent image spell, teleport spell, and thunderwave spell.

You can use the grimoire as your spellbook, and you can scribe new spells into it as normal. When you prepare wizard spells using the grimoire, the number of wizard spells you can prepare increases by 1.
