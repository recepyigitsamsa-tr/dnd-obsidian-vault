## Description

These tinker's goggles have 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to shoot a beam of fiery light from the goggles at a creature you can see within 120 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 damage fire damage. The goggles regain {@dice 1d3} expended charges daily at dawn.

### Cursed

The goggles are cursed, and becoming attuned to them extends the curse to you. You can't remove the goggles or end your attunement to them until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell spell or similar magic.

Whenever you use the goggles' fiery beam and the target rolls a 20 on the {@dice d20} for the saving throw, the goggles expose you to a flash of violent {@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light}. As a result, you have the blinded condition for 24 hours.
