## Description

While attuned to this device, you have a +1 bonus to Charisma saving throws, and you have advantage on Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) checks.

### Aberrant Ally

You can conjure an aberrant creature from the chaos of the multiverse to serve you. This functions as the conjure celestial spell spell (no {@status concentration} required), except the creature you summon is an aberration of challenge rating 4 or lower. Once you use this feature of the far gear, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

### Unnatural Bane

You can cast the bane spell spell (save DC 15 Saving Throw), which affects any number of creatures within range for 1 minute. Once you use this feature of the far gear, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

### Part of a Whole

While this component is not installed in the Orrery of the Wanderer|AI, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.
