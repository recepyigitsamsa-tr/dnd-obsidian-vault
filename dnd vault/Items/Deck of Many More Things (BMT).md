## Description

Over the centuries since the first Deck of Many Things was created, many have sought and failed to replicate it. But some have created new cards. These forty-four additional cards are known collectively as the Deck of Many More Things. (More information on creating new cards for this deck appears in chapter 2.)

Like the Deck of Many Things, the Deck of Many More Things manifests differently on various worlds. While it can include fewer or different cards, it frequently appears with a Deck of Many Things as part of a combined deck of sixty-six illuminated cards. The combined deck is usually protected by a box or pouch. The forty-four cards of the Deck of Many More Things bear similar imagery to those in the Deck of Many Things and have potent magical effects, which are detailed later in this description. Notably, cards from the Deck of Many More Things are more likely to be beneficial, though about a third of them are still dangerous.

Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Unless a card allows you to draw additional cards, any cards drawn exceeding this number have no effect.

As soon as you draw a card, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. Unless a card states otherwise, if you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.

Unless it is the Fool or the Jester card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.

The DM can use the physical cards provided in The Deck of Many Things card set to build a combined Deck of Many Things and Deck of Many More Things, including whichever cards they desire. Alternatively, roll on the Deck of Many More Things table below to randomly determine what cards are drawn.

### Aberration

You gain telepathy within a range of 90 feet.

### Beast

You immediately transform into a {@filter random Beast with a CR of 5 or lower|bestiary|source=|Challenge Rating=[&0;&5]|type=beast}. Your game statistics—including your ability scores, hit points, and possible actions—are replaced by the Beast's game statistics, and any nonmagical equipment you're wearing or carrying melds into your new form and can't be used. Any magic items you're carrying drop in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your new form.

You remain transformed in this way for {@dice 2d12} days; nothing can alter your form while you're under the effects of this card, but the Wish spell spell can end the transformation early. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the same state you were in when you initially transformed.

### Book

You gain the ability to speak, read, and write {@dice 1d6 + 2} languages of your choice.

### Bridge

You gain the ability to cast the Time Stop spell spell {@dice 1d3} times. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

### Campfire

You immediately gain the benefits of finishing a long rest.

### Cavern

You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. You also gain the ability to move up, down, across vertical surfaces, and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

### Celestial

You sprout a pair of softly luminescent, feathered wings from your back and gain a flying speed of 30 feet.

### Construct

A homunculus appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The appearance of the homunculus is determined by the DM, and the homunculus treats you as its creator.

### Corpse

You immediately drop to 0 hit points, have the unconscious condition condition, and must begin making death saving throws. Spells and other magical effects that restore hit points have no effect on you until you are stabilized. If you fail three death saving throws, you die and can be resurrected only by the Wish spell spell.

### Crossroads

Roll a {@dice d20}. If the roll is even, you age {@dice 1d10} years. If the roll is odd, you become younger by {@dice 1d10} years, to a minimum of 1 year. This effect can be undone only by the Wish spell spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.

### Door

You gain the ability to cast the Gate spell spell {@dice 1d4} times, requiring no material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

### Dragon

A dragon egg appears at your feet and immediately hatches into a dragon wyrmling. The type of dragon is chosen by the DM. The wyrmling views you as its parent and is staunchly loyal to you and your allies.

### Elemental

You become immune to one of the following damage types (choose immediately upon drawing this card): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

### Expert

Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.

### Fey

A fey crossing opens into the Feywild, and you're immediately pulled through it, disappearing in a flash of rainbow-colored light. You draw no more cards.

The fey crossing appears as a shimmering fractal of light above the deck, and it remains open for 1 minute after the card is drawn. The precise location in the Feywild to which the fey crossing leads is determined by the DM.

### Fiend

A powerful Fiend appears in a nearby unoccupied space and offers you a deal. The precise nature of this deal is up to the DM, but usually the Fiend offers some material reward in exchange for you and your allies completing a task for the Fiend. The Fiend is indifferent to you and can be bargained with; it keeps its side of any bargain it makes, though it might twist the wording of any agreement to suit its purposes. If attacked, or if negotiations fail and you refuse the Fiend's offer, it returns to its home plane.

### Giant

You immediately grow {@dice 2d10} inches in height, and your hit point maximum and current hit points both increase by 20.

### Humanoid

You can immediately choose to stop drawing from the deck, regardless of how many cards you initially declared.

### Lance

All your ability scores increase by 1, to a maximum of 20.

### Mage

Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.

### Map

At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can mentally name or describe an object or individual that is familiar to you. You immediately know the location of the object or individual, as well as the distance between you and the object or individual, even if the object or individual is on a different plane of existence. If you named an individual, you know if they are alive and any conditions they have. If you named an object, you know if it is broken or not. If you named a magic item that has charges, you know how many charges it has remaining.

### Maze

You gain {@dice 1d3} levels of exhaustion condition.

### Mine

A pile of {@dice 2d6} gems (each worth 5,000 gp) and {@dice 1d10} chunks of precious ore (each worth 2,500 gp) appears at your feet.

### Monstrosity

A {@filter Large or larger Monstrosity with a challenge rating of 10 or less|bestiary|source=|Challenge Rating=[&0;&10]|type=monstrosity|size=l;h;g} (chosen by the DM) appears in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of you. The creature is hostile toward you and attacks immediately. The creature disappears when it is killed or when you are reduced to 0 hit points. If there isn't enough space for a Large or larger creature to appear, this card has no effect.

### Ooze

A gelatinous cube immediately appears in your space and engulfs you. The gelatinous cube is hostile and remains until it is destroyed. If there isn't enough space for the gelatinous cube to appear, this card has no effect.

### Path

Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

### Pit

A pit opens beneath you. You plummet 3d6 × 10 damage feet, take damage from the fall, and have the prone condition condition.

### Plant

You gain the ability to cast Speak with Plants spell without using a spell slot; you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. If you have spell slots of 3rd level or higher, you can cast this spell using them. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

### Priest

Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.

### Prisoner

Glowing chains made of magical force appear and wrap around you. You have the restrained condition condition until the chains are destroyed or you are freed. While you have this condition, you can't cast spells, and any magic items you're wearing or carrying have their properties suppressed. You draw no more cards. The chains are immune to damage and can't be dispelled using the Dispel Magic spell spell or similar magic. However, a Disintegrate spell spell destroys the chains instantly, freeing you. Another creature can also free you by succeeding on a DC 30 Saving Throw Dexterity check using thieves' tools|PHB.

### Ring

A {@filter rare or rarer magic ring|items|source=|type=ring|rarity=rare;very rare;legendary;artifact|category=} appears on your finger. If you have the attunement slots available, you're automatically attuned to the ring when it appears. The DM chooses the ring.

### Shield

A {@filter rare or rarer suit of magic armor|items|source=|type=light armor;heavy armor;medium armor|rarity=rare;very rare;legendary;artifact|category=} that you are proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the armor. If you lack proficiency with any armor, your base AC instead now equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor.

### Ship

You gain proficiency in three skills chosen by the DM.

### Staff

A {@filter rare or rarer magic rod, staff, or wand|items|source=|type=rod;wand;staff|rarity=rare;very rare;legendary;artifact|category=} appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.

### Stairway

You can choose to either decrease your number of declared draws by two or receive a {@filter rare or rarer wondrous item|items|source=|type=wondrous item|rarity=rare;very rare;legendary;artifact|category=}, which appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.

### Statue

You immediately have the petrified condition condition as your body is transformed into marble. The petrification lasts until you are freed with the Greater Restoration spell spell or similar magic.

### Tavern

Your Charisma score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.

### Temple

A deity or entity of similar power becomes bound to aid you. At any point in time between drawing the card and when you die, you can use your action to call on this entity for divine intervention, and the entity is bound to answer. The parameters and nature of this intervention are chosen by the DM. If you die without having used this intervention, the deity fulfills its obligation by casting the Resurrection spell spell on you. Once the entity has answered your call for divine intervention or resurrected you, the entity is no longer bound to aid you.

### Tomb

At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can cast the True Resurrection spell spell once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

### Tower

Draw two additional cards beyond your declared number of draws. The magic of these cards doesn't immediately take effect; instead, choose one of the two additional cards to keep, returning the other to the deck. The magic of the card you keep takes effect immediately thereafter.

### Tree

Your skin immediately becomes rough, like tree bark. Your base AC now equals 15 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor, but you have vulnerability to fire damage. This transformation can be undone only by the Wish spell spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.

### Undead

Somewhere on the Material Plane, a revenant rises. This revenant blames you for its existence and relentlessly hunts you to exact its revenge. The revenant exists until either 1 year passes, the revenant kills you, or you use a Wish spell spell to banish it permanently to the afterlife.

### Warrior

Your Strength score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.

### Well

You learn three cantrips of your choice from any spell list.
