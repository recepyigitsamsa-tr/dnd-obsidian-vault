## Description

These mithral-frame goggles with clear diamond lenses were used by the evoker Danoth Oro to spot invisible condition enemies and scout areas from afar.

### Dormant

While wearing the goggles in their dormant state, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) and Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on sight.
