## Description

While this doll is within 5 feet of you, you can spend a {@variantrule Short Rest|XPHB} telling it to say up to six phrases, none of which can be more than six words long, and set a condition under which the doll speaks each phrase. You can also replace old phrases with new ones. Whatever the condition, it must occur within 5 feet of the doll to make it speak. For example, whenever someone picks up the doll, it might say, "I want a piece of candy." The doll's phrases are lost when your {@variantrule Attunement|XPHB} to the doll ends.
