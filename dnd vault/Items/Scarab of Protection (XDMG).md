## Description

This beetle-shaped medallion provides three benefits while it is on your person.

### Defense

You gain a +1 bonus to {@variantrule Armor Class|XPHB}.

### Preservation

The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a Necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an Undead, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.

### Spell Resistance

You have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on saving throws against spells.
