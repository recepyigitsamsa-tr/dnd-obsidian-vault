## Description

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear within 60 feet of you. These spirits use the berserker statistics. They return to Ysgard after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

The silver horn summons {@dice 2d4 + 2} berserker||berserkers.

The berserker||berserkers are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.
