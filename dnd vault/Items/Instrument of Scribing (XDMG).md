## Description

This musical instrument|XPHB has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While you are playing it, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to expend 1 charge and write a magical message on a nonmagical object or surface that you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The message can be up to six words long and is written in a language you know. If you are a Bard, you can scribe an additional seven words and make the message glow faintly, allowing it to be seen in nonmagical {@variantrule Darkness|XPHB}. Casting the Dispel Magic|XPHB spell spell on the message erases it. Otherwise, the message fades away after 24 hours.
