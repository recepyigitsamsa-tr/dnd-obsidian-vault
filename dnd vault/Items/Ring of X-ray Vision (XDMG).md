## Description

While wearing this ring, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to gain X-ray vision with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead block the vision.

Whenever you use the ring again before taking a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, you must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion|XPHB condition level.
