## Description

While this bowl is filled with water and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to summon a Water Elemental|XMM. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the bowl as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your {@variantrule Initiative|XPHB} count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}. The bowl can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It holds about 3 gallons.
