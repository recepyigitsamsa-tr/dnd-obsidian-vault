## Description

The Korolnor Scepter is one of ten Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, forged by the dwarven gods and given to the ruling houses of the ancient dwarven empire. The Korolnor Scepter's location was unknown for the longest time until a storm giant queen, Neri, found it in a barnacle-covered shipwreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. The Ruling Scepters are all roughly the same size and shape, but their materials and properties vary.

The Korolnor Scepter is a tapered mithral rod as thick and long as a dwarf's forearm, with a small platinum knob at the bottom and a rounded disk adorned with a ring of seven tiny blue gems at the top.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this scepter, which can be wielded as a magic club.

You can use the properties of the Wyrmskull Throne|SKT, as well as the properties of the scepter itself. The scepter has 10 charges, and it regains {@dice 1d6 + 4} expanded charges at dawn. Its properties are as follows:
