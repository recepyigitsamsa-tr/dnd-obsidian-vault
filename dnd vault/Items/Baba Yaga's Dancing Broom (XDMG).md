## Description

The archfey _Baba Yaga_ crafted many of these magic brooms. No two appear exactly alike. While holding the broom, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to transform it into an Animated Broom|XMM under your control. The broom then moves into an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The broom acts immediately after you on your {@variantrule Initiative|XPHB} count and remains animate until you take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} and use a command word to render it inanimate.

On your turn, you can mentally command the animated broom if it is within 30 feet of you and you don't have the Incapacitated|XPHB condition condition (no action required). You decide what action the broom takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.

If the broom is reduced to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, it shatters and is destroyed. If the broom reverts to its inanimate form before losing all its {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} it regains all of them.
