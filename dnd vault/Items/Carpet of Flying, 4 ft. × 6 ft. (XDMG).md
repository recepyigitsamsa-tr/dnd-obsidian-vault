## Description

You can make this carpet hover and fly by taking a {@action Magic|XPHB} action and using the carpet's command word. It moves according to your directions if you are within 30 feet of it.

A 4 ft. × 6 ft. carpet can carry up to 400 lb. at a fly speed of 60 feet. A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but its {@variantrule Fly Speed|XPHB} is halved if it carries more than its normal capacity.
