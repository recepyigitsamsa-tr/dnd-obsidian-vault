## Description

You can use this pen to write on any surface. You decide whether the writing is visible or invisible condition, but the writing is always visible to a person with the Mark of Scribing.

Any creature with the Mark of Scribing can use an action to touch the invisible condition writing, making it visible to all.

If you use the pen to write on a creature that isn't a construct, the writing fades after 7 days.
