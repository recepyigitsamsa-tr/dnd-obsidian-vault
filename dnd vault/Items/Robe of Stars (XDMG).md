## Description

This black or dark-blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it.

Six stars, located on the robe's upper-front portion, are particularly large. While wearing this robe, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to remove one of the stars and expend it to cast the level 5 version of Magic Missile|XPHB spell. Daily at dusk, {@dice 1d6} removed stars reappear on the robe.

While you wear the robe, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the last space you occupied or, if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.
