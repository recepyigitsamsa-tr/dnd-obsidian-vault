## Description

An earthboard is a slab of granite about three inches thick, nine feet long, and two feet wide, with smooth, tapered ends. However, its mundane appearance belies its unique elemental power, which reduces its weight to 40 pounds while a creature is attuned to it. _The Earth Ashari of Terrah_ can often be seen with these stone boards upon their backs as they trek into the crags of the _Cliffkeep Mountains_.

While standing on an earthboard, you gain the following benefits:

These benefits last until you end your turn not standing on the earthboard.
