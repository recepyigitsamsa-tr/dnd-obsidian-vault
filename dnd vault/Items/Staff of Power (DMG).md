## Description

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.

The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains {@dice 2d8 + 4} expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage roll but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regain {@dice 1d8 + 2} charges.

### Power Strike

When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 damage force damage to the target.

### Spells

While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: cone of cold spell (5 charges), fireball spell (5th-level version, 5 charges), globe of invulnerability spell (6 charges), hold monster spell (5 charges), levitate spell (2 charges), lightning bolt spell (5th-level version, 5 charges), magic missile spell (1 charge), ray of enfeeblement spell (1 charge), or wall of force spell (5 charges).

### Retributive Strike

You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.

You have a {@chance 50} chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 Ã— the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.
