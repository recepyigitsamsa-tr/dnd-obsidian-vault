## Description

This powder resembles fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you take a {@action Utilize|XPHB} action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within a 10-foot {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} originating from you have the Invisible|XPHB condition condition for {@dice 2d4} minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. Immediately after an affected creature makes an attack roll, deals damage, or casts a spell, the Invisible|XPHB condition condition ends for that creature.
