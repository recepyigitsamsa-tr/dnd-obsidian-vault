## Description

This slender, hollow staff is made of glass yet is as strong as oak. It weighs 3 pounds. You must be attuned to the staff to gain its benefits and cast its spells.

While holding the staff, you have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

The staff has 10 charges, which are used to fuel the spells within it. With the staff in hand, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from the staff if the spell is on your class's spell list: mage armor spell (1 charge) or shield spell (2 charges). No components are required.

The staff regains {@dice 1d6 + 4} expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the staff shatters and is destroyed.
