## Description

When you take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to read this scroll, a Blob of Annihilation|XMM appears in an unoccupied space on the ground or in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself.

The Blob of Annihilation|XMM is {@variantrule Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB|Hostile} toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}. If the Blob of Annihilation|XMM is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.
