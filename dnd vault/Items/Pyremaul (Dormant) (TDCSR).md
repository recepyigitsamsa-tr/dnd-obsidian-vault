## Description

Forged from deep red iron, this massive hammer is set with a brilliant fire opal that shimmers with eternal flame. It is rumored to be currently wielded by _Grand Legate Phaestor, the fire giant ruler of Vulkanon_, somewhere beneath the _Cliffkeep Mountains_.

### Dormant

While Pyremaul is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage fire damage.

Additionally, you can choose to have this weapon shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet (no action required).
