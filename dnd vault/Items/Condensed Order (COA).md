## Description

Condensed Order is a silvery powder that can be extracted from those of a lawful persuasion. Devils bound for the warfronts of Avernus take flasks and snuff boxes of the stuff to fortify themselves against exposure to the raw chaos of demons. Taking the substance requires an action and makes you immune to the flesh warping feature of demonic ichor. It also gives you advantage on saving throws against any effect from a demonic source. These benefits last for 8 hours.
