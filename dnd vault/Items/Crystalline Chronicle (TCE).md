## Description

An etched crystal sphere the size of a grapefruit hums faintly and pulses with irregular flares of inner light. While you are touching the crystal, you can retrieve and store information and spells within the crystal at the same rate as reading and writing. When found, the crystal contains the following spells: detect thoughts spell, intellect fortress|TCE spell, Rary's telepathic bond spell, sending spell, telekinesis spell, Tasha's mind whip|TCE spell, and Tenser's floating disk spell. It functions as a spellbook for you, with its spells and other writing psychically encoded within it.

While you are holding the crystal, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells, and you know the mage hand spell, mind sliver|TCE spell (appears in this book), and message spell cantrips if you don't already know them.

The crystal has 3 charges, and it regains {@dice 1d3} expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:
