## Description

This slender, hollow staff is made of glass yet is as strong as oak. It weighs 3 pounds. While holding the staff, you have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

### Spells

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can expend the requisite number of charges to cast one of the following spells from the staff: mage armor spell (1 charge) or shield spell (2 charges).

The staff regains {@dice 1d6 + 4} expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the staff shatters and is destroyed.
