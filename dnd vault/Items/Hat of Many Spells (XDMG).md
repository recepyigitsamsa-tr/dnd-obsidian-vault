## Description

This pointed hat has the following properties.

### Spellcasting Focus

While holding the hat, you can use it as a {@variantrule Spellcasting Focus|XPHB} for your Wizard spells. Any spell you cast using the hat gains a special Somatic component: you must reach into the hat and "pull" the spell out of it.

### Unknown Spell

While holding the hat, you can try to cast a level 1+ spell you don't know. The spell must be on the Wizard spell list, it must be of a level you can cast, and it can't have Material components costing more than 1,000 GP. Once you decide on the spell, you must expend a spell slot of the spell's level. Then, to determine whether you cast the spell, make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana|XPHB}) check (DC 10 Saving Throw plus the spell's level). On a successful check, you cast the spell using its normal casting time, and you can't use this property again until you finish a {@variantrule Short Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}. On a failed check, you fail to cast the spell and a random effect occurs instead, determined by rolling on the following table.

Any spell you cast from the hat uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.
