## Description

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the web spell spell (save DC 15 Saving Throw) from it.

The wand regains {@dice 1d6 + 1} expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
