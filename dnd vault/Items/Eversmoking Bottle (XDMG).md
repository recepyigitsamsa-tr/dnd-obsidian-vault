## Description

As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you can open or close this bottle.

Opening the bottle causes thick smoke to billow out, forming a cloud that fills a 60-foot {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} originating from the bottle. The area within the smoke is {@variantrule Heavily Obscured|XPHB}.

Each minute the bottle remains open, the size of the {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum size of 120 feet.

Closing the bottle causes the cloud to become fixed in place until it disperses after 10 minutes. A strong wind (such as that created by the Gust of Wind|XPHB spell spell) disperses the cloud after 1 minute.
