## Description

This necklace has {@dice 1d6 + 3} beads hanging from it. You can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a level 3 Fireball|XPHB spell (save DC 15 Saving Throw).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, at one time. When you do so, increase the damage of the Fireball by 1d6 damage for each bead after the first (maximum {@dice 12d6}).
