## Description

This small handheld device features a glass pane with a glowing display that responds to your touch.

The controller is powered by an energy cell stored in the device. Placing a full energy cell in the device gives the device 3 charges.

As an action while holding this device, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause one of the following effects:

### Control

One Construct of your choice within 60 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or have the charmed condition condition for 1 minute. While charmed condition in this way, the Construct obeys your verbal commands, and you and the Construct can communicate remotely with each other through the device. Whenever the charmed condition Construct takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Disrupt

Constructs of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or have the incapacitated condition condition for 1 minute. An incapacitated condition Construct can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Replacing the Energy Cell

While the device has charges remaining, its energy cell can't be removed. Once the device has 0 charges, you can replace the energy cell with a new cell by using an action or a bonus action.
