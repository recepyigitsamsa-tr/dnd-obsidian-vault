## Description

The Lorehold Primer is a magic textbook created at Strixhaven's Lorehold College. The primer has 3 charges, and it regains {@dice 1d3} expended charges daily at dawn. If you make an Intelligence ({@skill History}) or Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check while holding the primer, you can expend 1 charge to give yourself {@dice 1d4} bonus to the check, immediately after you roll the {@dice d20}.

In addition, if you study the primer at the end of a long rest, you can choose one 1st-level spell from the cleric or wizard spell list. Before you finish your next long rest, you can cast the chosen spell once without a spell slot if you are holding the primer. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
