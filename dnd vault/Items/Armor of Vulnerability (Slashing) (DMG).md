## Description

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to slashing damage.

### Curse

This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed you have vulnerability to bludgeoning and piercing damage.
