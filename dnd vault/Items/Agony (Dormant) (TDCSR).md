## Description

Utilized in countless tortures and slow executions, the hooked chains of this brutal weapon constantly show dried blood and rot. Legend says that Agony was wielded in the _Calamity_ by the gnoll scion of a flesh-eating Demon Lord.

### Dormant

While Agony is in a dormant state, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Whenever you damage a creature with Agony, that creature is marked for 10 minutes or until you damage a different creature. When you hit a creature marked in this way with this weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage piercing damage.
