## Description

While you wear this cloak, it magically projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while your {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} is 0.
