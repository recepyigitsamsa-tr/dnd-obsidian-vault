## Description

Exandria's most infamous drug, suude|TDCSR is a glittering powder made from _residuum_. It was first developed by power-hungry archmages in the _Age of Arcanum_ as an incense burned to enhance focus during ritual spellcasting. The secret to its refinement has been lost and rediscovered a variety of times since the _Calamity_, and many different types of suude|TDCSR have been developed by arcanists in search of ever-greater power. It has terrible addictive and mentally degenerative properties, even when used sparingly.

After burning suude|TDCSR within a vessel and inhaling its fumes as an action, you take 22 (4d10 damage) psychic damage and must make a DC 10 Saving Throw Constitution {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw}. On a failure, you become poisoned condition for 1 hour and fall unconscious condition for 1 minute, or until you are shaken awake as an action. During this time, the world seems to move in slow motion, and your vision is twisted in kaleidoscopic colorsâ€”yet your focus is never distorted. If one dose of suude|TDCSR, or more, is used within 1 hour of another, the DC of the Constitution {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw} is increased by 5 per additional dose. If you fail this save by 10 or more, you instantly drop to 0 hit points.

On a success, you gain the ability to use one of the following Metamagic options as a sorcerer for the next minute, requiring no sorcery points. The type of Metamagic you gain access to depends on the type of suude|TDCSR, and once you use it, you can't use it again until you inhale suude|TDCSR again.

Red suude allows you to use the {@optfeature Distant Spell|PHB} Metamagic option.
