## Description

This robe has 3 charges, and it regains {@dice 1d3} expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} in a 30-foot radius and {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} for an additional 30 feet, and creatures that can see you have {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on attack rolls against you. Any creature in the {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} that can see you when the robe's power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or have the Stunned|XPHB condition condition until the effect ends.
