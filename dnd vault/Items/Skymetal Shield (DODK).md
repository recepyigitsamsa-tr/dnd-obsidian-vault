## Description

This shield is constructed from hammered meteoric iron and embossed with a delerium crystal. When you are hit with a melee or ranged attack while wielding this shield, you can use your reaction to absorb residual energy from the attack. You suffer damage and effects from the attack as normal, and the shield gains 1 charge. The shield can have a maximum of 5 charges. Unexpended charges are lost each day at dawn.

As an action while wielding the shield, you can expend all its charges to release a forceful blast. Creatures within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, creatures in the area take 1d6 damage force damage for each expended charge, and are flung back 10 feet and knocked prone.
