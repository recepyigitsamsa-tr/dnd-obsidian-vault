## Description

When you don this circlet of gnarled onyx, black barbs dig into your head, imparting power to you as the circlet twists your appearance to amuse {@deity The Spider Queen|Exandria|TDCSR}. The current resting place of the Circlet of Barbed Vision is unknown, but rumor has it that a spectral assassin known as Jourrael, the Caedogeist|TDCSR|the Inevitable End seeks this relic.

### Dormant

While the Circlet of Barbed Vision is in a dormant state, you have {@quickref Advantage and Disadvantage|PHB|2|0|advantage} on initiative rolls while you wear it, but your Charisma score decreases by 2. Your Charisma score returns to normal if you remove the circlet, but you take 4d6 damage psychic damage when you do so.

Additionally, when you make an attack roll, you can use your reaction to gain a +5 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the GM says whether the attack hits or misses. You can't use this property again until you finish a {@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short or long rest}.
