## Description

The sheer amount of leftover arcane power within the whitestone|TDCSR of the mountains is incredibly receptive to enchantment. Magic items that incorporate at least an ounce of whitestone|TDCSR into their construction require only one-quarter the creation time of other magic items. Some alchemists in _Emon_ have discovered that dissolving whitestone|TDCSR with specific acids can leave behind pure residuum, which can substitute for expensive spell components when such materials are not readily available.

If a spell has a component cost that consumes the component, its caster can substitute the required component for an amount of residuum of an equal value. One pound of pure residuum is worth approximately 500 gp in most markets, though it becomes extremely expensive and difficult to find outside of _Emon_ or the city of _Whitestone_ itself.

Residuum can also be heated and blown into glass, forming a shimmering, greenish surface. Residuum slates or orbs can be used in stationary enchanting tables. Archmages willing to pay exorbitant rates—easily 20,000 gp or more—may acquire an Residuum enchanting slate|TDCSR|enchanting slate that can be used to expedite the creation of all magic items. Using such a table allows anyone crafting a magic item to do so in one-quarter of the usual time.
