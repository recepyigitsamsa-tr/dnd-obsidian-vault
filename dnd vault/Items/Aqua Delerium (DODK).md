## Description

This purple potion glows dimly with octarine light. It swirls and sparkles in its small stoppered bottle.

When you drink this potion, you regain expended spell slots. Roll {@dice 1d6} - you choose spell slots to regain that have a combined level that is equal to or less than the result. None of the slots can be higher than 5th level.

For one hour after drinking aqua delerium, roll {@dice 1d20} each time you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. On a 1, you trigger a random arcane anomaly (see Dungeons of Drakkenheim).

If you consume more than one dose of aqua delerium before finishing your next long rest, you take (1d12 damage) necrotic damage for each spell level regained, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken until you finish a long rest. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way.

When a creature who cannot cast spells using spell slots drinks aqua delerium, it takes 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage and gains one {@adventure level of contamination|DoDk|12}.
