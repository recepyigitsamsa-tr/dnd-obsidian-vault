## Description

The hulking plainscow is an exceptionally sturdy beast of burden native to the _Dividing Plains_ and used by the people of central Tal'Dorei for centuries. Though many wild herds still roam the plains, domesticated plainscows are more common, used as {@quickref Mounts and Vehicles|PHB|1|0|mounts}, pack animals, and livestock. Plainscows are unusually empathetic for beasts, and often bond with a rider for life. They stand 6 feet tall, weigh about two tons, and live for 70 years.
