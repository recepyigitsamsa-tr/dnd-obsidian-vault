## Description

This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to use:

When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.

Statistics for the Rowboat|XPHB and Keelboat|XPHB appear in the _Player's Handbook_. If either vessel is reduced to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, the Folding Boat is destroyed.
