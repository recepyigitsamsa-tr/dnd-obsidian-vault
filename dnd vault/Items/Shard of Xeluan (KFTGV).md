## Description

This 1-foot-long shard of obsidian has veins of silver and gold beneath its cold surface.

### Empowered Magic

While holding the shard, you can use it as a spellcasting focus, and it gives you a +1 bonus to your spell attack rolls.

### Enhanced Strength

Your Strength score increases by 4 while the shard is on your person. The shard can't raise your Strength score above 22.

### Curse

Attuning to this item extends its curse to you. You remain cursed until you are targeted by a remove curse spell spell or similar magic, or until the shard is reattached to Xeluan's petrified condition heart.

The shard's curse causes misfortune to befall you. When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, roll on the Shard Misfortunes table to determine the misfortune. For as long as this misfortune lasts, no other shard misfortunes befall you.
