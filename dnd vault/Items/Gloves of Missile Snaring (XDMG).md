## Description

If you're hit by an attack roll made with a Ranged or Thrown weapon while wearing these gloves, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to reduce the damage by {@dice 1d10} plus your Dexterity modifier if you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the ammunition or weapon if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.
