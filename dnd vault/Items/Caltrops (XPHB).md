## Description

As a {@action Utilize|XPHB} action, you can spread Caltrops from their bag to cover a 5-foot-square area within 5 feet of yourself. A creature that enters this area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take 1 Piercing damage and have its {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. It takes 10 minutes to recover the Caltrops.
