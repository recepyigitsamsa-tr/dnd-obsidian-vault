## Description

While wearing this ring, you regain {@dice 1d6} {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} every 10 minutes if you have at least 1 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB|Hit Point}. If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after {@dice 1d6 + 1} days if you have at least 1 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB|Hit Point} the whole time.
