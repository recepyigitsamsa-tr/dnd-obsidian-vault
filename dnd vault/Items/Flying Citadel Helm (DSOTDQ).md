## Description

The function of this ornate chair is to propel and maneuver a flying citadel on which it has been installed. The chair has AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It is destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points.

The sensation of being attuned to a flying citadel helm is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after one's arm or leg falls asleep, but not as intense.

While attuned to a flying citadel helm and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as you maintain {@status concentration} (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell):

If no creature attuned to the helm is maintaining {@status concentration}, the citadel remains motionless in its space.

### Transfer Attunement

You can use an action or a bonus action to touch a willing spellcaster, whereupon that creature attunes to the flying citadel helm immediately, and your attunement to the flying citadel helm ends.

### Crash

Should the flying citadel helm be destroyed, the citadel it is installed on loses power and begins to crumble. If the crumbling citadel is in the air, it descends at a rate of 30 feet per round, or 300 feet per minute. Any creature on the citadel or on the ground within 120 feet of the citadel when it lands must make a DC 20 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 39 (6d12 damage) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
