## Description

When you take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to read this scroll, a Kraken|XMM appears in an unoccupied space in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself. A kraken|XMM requires a body of water large enough to contain it, or the summoning fails and the scroll is wasted

The Kraken|XMM is {@variantrule Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB|Hostile} toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}. If the Kraken|XMM is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.
