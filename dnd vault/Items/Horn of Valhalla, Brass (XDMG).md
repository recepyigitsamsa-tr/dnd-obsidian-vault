## Description

You can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. Each spirit uses the Berserker|XMM stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}. The spirits look like living, breathing warriors, and they have {@variantrule Immunity|XPHB} to the Charmed|XPHB condition and Frightened|XPHB condition conditions. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

A brass horn summons 3 Berserker|XMM|Berserkers. To use the brass horn, you must have {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB} with all Simple weapons.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned Berserker|XMM|Berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are {@variantrule Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB|Friendly} to you and your allies and follow your commands.
