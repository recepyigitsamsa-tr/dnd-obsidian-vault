## Description

This marble-size crystal sphere glows with extraplanar energy.

As part of attuning to this item, you press the crystal sphere to the hilt of a nonmagical melee weapon of your choice, magically attaching the sphere to the weapon. The weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. While wielding this weapon, you gain the following benefits:

When you end your attunement to the sphere, the sphere harmlessly detaches from the weapon, and the weapon reverts to a nonmagical piece of equipment.
