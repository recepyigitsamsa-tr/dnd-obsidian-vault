## Description

These berries are dark brown and bitter. A full-grown sinda berry bush has {@dice 4d6} berries growing on it. A bush plucked of all its berries grows new berries in {@dice 1d4} months. Picked berries lose their freshness and efficacy after 24 hours.

Fresh sinda berries can be eaten raw or crushed and added to a drink to dull the bitterness. A creature that consumes at least ten fresh sinda berries gains advantage on saving throws against disease and poison for the next 24 hours.
