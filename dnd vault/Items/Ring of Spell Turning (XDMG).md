## Description

While wearing this ring, you have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on saving throws against spells. If you succeed on the save for a spell of level 7 or lower, the spell has no effect on you. If that spell targeted only you and didn't create an area of effect, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to deflect the spell back at the spell's caster; the caster must make a saving throw against the spell using their own spell save DC.
