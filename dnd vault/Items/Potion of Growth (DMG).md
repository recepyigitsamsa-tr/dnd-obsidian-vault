## Description

When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the enlarge/reduce spell spell for {@dice 1d4} hours (no {@status concentration} required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
