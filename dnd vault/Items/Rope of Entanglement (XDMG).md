## Description

This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of the rope, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to command the other end to dart forward and entangle one creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained|XPHB condition condition. You can release the target by letting go of your end of the rope (causing the rope to coil up in the target's space) or by using a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to repeat the command (causing the rope to coil up in your hand).

A target Restrained|XPHB condition by the rope can take an action to make its choice of a DC 15 Saving Throw Strength ({@skill Athletics|XPHB}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics|XPHB}) check. On a successful check, the target is no longer Restrained|XPHB condition by the rope. If you're still holding onto the rope when a target escapes from it, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to command the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope coils up in the target's space.

The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and {@variantrule Immunity|XPHB} to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB|Hit Point} every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB|Hit Point}. If the rope drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, it is destroyed.
