## Description

This volatile alchemical powder comes in a small pouch. When ignited by an open flame or a fuse, the powder explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the exploding pouch must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 damage bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A character can bind multiple pouches of blasting powder together so they explode at the same time. Each additional pouch increases the damage by {@dice 1d6} (maximum of {@dice 10d6}) and the blast radius by 5 feet (maximum of 20 feet).
