## Description

While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the gust of wind spell spell (save DC 13 Saving Throw) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn't be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative {@chance 20} chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.
