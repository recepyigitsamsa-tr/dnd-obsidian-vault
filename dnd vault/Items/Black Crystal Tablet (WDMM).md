## Description

Any creature that attunes to the tablet must make a DC 20 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw at the end of its next long rest. On a failed save, the creature becomes afflicted with a random form of long-term madness (see "_Madness_" in chapter 8 of the _Dungeon Master's Guide_).

As an action, a creature attuned to the Black Crystal Tablet can use it to cast eyebite spell or gate spell (the portal created by this spell links to the Far Realm only). After the tablet is used to cast a spell, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
