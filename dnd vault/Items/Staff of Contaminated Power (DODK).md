## Description

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 1 charge each hour it rests in the Deep Haze. You can also touch a delerium crystal to the staff, which causes it to regain {@dice 2d8 + 4} charges, then the crystal crumbles to dust. If you expend the last charge, you immediately gain {@dice 1d6} {@adventure levels of contamination|DoDk|12}.

### Spells

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: delerium orb|DoDk spell (1 charge), warp bolt|DoDk spell (2 charges), ride the rifts|DoDk spell (3 charges), delerium blast|DoDk spell (4 charges), conjure the deep haze|DoDk spell (5 charges), and ray of contamination|DoDk spell (6 charges). You don't gain any {@adventure contamination levels|DoDk|12} when you cast these spells using charges from this staff.
