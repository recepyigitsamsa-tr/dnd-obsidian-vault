## Description

An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 damage Psychic damage.

You can play the Fochlucan Bandore to cast one of the following spells: Fly|XPHB spell, Invisibility|XPHB spell, Levitate|XPHB spell, Protection from Evil and Good|XPHB spell, Entangle|XPHB spell, Faerie Fire|XPHB spell, Shillelagh|XPHB spell, and Speak with Animals|XPHB spell. Once the Fochlucan Bandore has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
