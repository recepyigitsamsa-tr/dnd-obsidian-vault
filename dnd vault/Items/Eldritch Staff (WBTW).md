## Description

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The staff has 10 charges and regains {@dice 1d6 + 4} expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the staff is destroyed in an otherwise harmless burst of eldritch energy.

### Eldritch Attack

When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra 1d8 damage lightning damage.

### Eldritch Escape

If you take damage while holding the staff, you can use your reaction to expend 3 of the staff's charges, whereupon you turn invisible condition and teleport yourself, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. You remain invisible condition until the start of your next turn or until you attack, cast a spell, or deal damage.
