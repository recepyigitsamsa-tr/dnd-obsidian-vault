## Description

You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: burning hands spell (1 charge), fireball spell (3 charges), or wall of fire spell (4 charges).

The staff regains {@dice 1d6 + 4} expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
