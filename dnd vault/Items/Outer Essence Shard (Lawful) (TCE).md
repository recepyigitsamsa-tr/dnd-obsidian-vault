## Description

This flickering crystal holds the essence of an Outer Plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use that property.

### Property

You can end one of the following conditions affecting yourself or one creature you can see within 30 feet of you: charmed condition, blinded condition, deafened condition, frightened condition, poisoned condition, or stunned condition.
