## Description

This candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires a {@action Magic|XPHB} action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from its total burn time.

While lit, the candle sheds {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} in a 30-foot radius. While you are within that light, you have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on {@variantrule D20 Test|XPHB|D20 Tests}. In addition, a Cleric or Druid in the light can cast level 1 spells they have prepared without expending spell slots.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast Gate|XPHB spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle. The portal created by the spell links to a particular Outer Plane chosen by the DM or determined by rolling on the following table.
