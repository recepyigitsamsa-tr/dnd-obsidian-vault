## Description

This spherical glass orb contains an ignited delerium shard hovering gently within. Electrical currents of yellow, green, and purple energy streak from the crystal and cascade along the glass, rendering it warm to the touch.

As an action you can throw the orb up to 30 feet. It shatters on impact, releasing a 20-foot-radius burst of contaminated energy. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution save or take (8d6 damage) necrotic damage, and take one {@adventure level of contamination|DoDk|12}. In addition, an arcane anomaly (see Dungeons of Drakkenheim) occurs, centred on the point of impact.
