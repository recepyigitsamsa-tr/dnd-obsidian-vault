## Description

This cone-shaped hat is adorned with moons and stars. While you are wearing it, you gain the following benefits.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use the hat as a {@variantrule Spellcasting Focus|XPHB} for your Wizard spells.

### Unknown Spell

As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The cantrip must be on the Wizard spell list and have a casting time of an action, and you make a DC 10 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Arcana|XPHB}) check. On a successful check, you cast the spell. On a failed check, the spell fails, and the action used to cast the spell is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property again until you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}.
