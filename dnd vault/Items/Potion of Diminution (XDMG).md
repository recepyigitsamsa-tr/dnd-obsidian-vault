## Description

When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" effect of the Enlarge/Reduce|XPHB spell spell for {@dice 1d4} hours (no {@status Concentration|XPHB} required).

The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
