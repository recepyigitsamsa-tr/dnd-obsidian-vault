## Description

When you drink this potion, your physical age is reduced by {@dice 1d6 + 6} years, to a minimum of 13 years. Each time you subsequently drink a potion of longevity, there is a {@chance 10|10 percent||You grow older!|You become younger} cumulative chance that you instead age by {@dice 1d6 + 6} years. Suspended in this amber liquid are a scorpion's tail, an adder's fang, a dead spider, and a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened.
