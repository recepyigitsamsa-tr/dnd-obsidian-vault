## Description

Worried that you're going to pull out your dead sprite inside a clear glass bottle at a company function only to discover that three other people in the franchise have one as well? Then consider rolling on the Acquisitions Incorporated Trinkets table instead of the Trinket|phb|table in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook, to gain a unique trinket at character creation with a bit of Acq Inc flair.
