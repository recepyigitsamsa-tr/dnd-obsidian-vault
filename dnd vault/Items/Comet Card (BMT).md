## Description

As an action, you can hold this card aloft and call down a fiery meteor to a point you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Each creature within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 damage bludgeoning damage and 6d6 damage fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
