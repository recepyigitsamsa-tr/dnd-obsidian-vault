## Description

This staff has 10 charges.

### Insect Cloud

While holding the staff , you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action and expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to fill a 30-foot {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} originating from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making the area {@variantrule Heavily Obscured|XPHB} for creatures other than you. A strong wind (like that created by Gust of Wind|XPHB spell) disperses the swarm and ends the effect.

### Spells

While holding the staff, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack modifier. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.

### Regaining Charges

The staff regains {@dice 1d6 + 4} expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll {@dice 1d20}. On a 1, a swarm of insects consumes and destroys the staff, then disperses.
