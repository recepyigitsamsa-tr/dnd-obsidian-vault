## Description

While wearing this ring, you regain {@dice 1d6} hit points every 10 minutes, provided that you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after {@dice 1d6 + 1} days if you have at least 1 hit point the whole time.
