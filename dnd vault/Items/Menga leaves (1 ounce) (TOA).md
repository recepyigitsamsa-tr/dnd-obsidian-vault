## Description

The dried leaves of a menga bush can be ground, dissolved in a liquid, heated, and ingested. A creature that ingests 1 ounce of menga leaves in this fashion regains 1 hit point. A creature that ingests more than 5 ounces of menga leaves in a 24-hour period gains no additional benefit and must succeed on a DC 11 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious condition for 1 hour. The unconscious condition creature awakens if it takes at least 5 damage on one turn.

A healthy menga bush usually has {@dice 2d6} ounces of leaves. Once picked, the leaves require 1 day to dry out before they can confer any benefit.
