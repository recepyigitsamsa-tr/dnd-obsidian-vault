## Description

This staff can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.

The staff has 10 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using it, you can expend up to 3 charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage Force damage.

### Regaining Charges

The staff regains {@dice 1d6 + 4} expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll {@dice 1d20}. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical Quarterstaff.
