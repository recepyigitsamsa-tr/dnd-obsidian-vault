## Description

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the Haste|XPHB spell spell for 1 minute (no {@status Concentration|XPHB} required) without suffering the wave of lethargy that typically occurs when the effect ends.

This potion's yellow fluid is streaked with black and swirls on its own.
