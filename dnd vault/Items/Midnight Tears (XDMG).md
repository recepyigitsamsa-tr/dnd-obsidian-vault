## Description

A creature that ingests Midnight Tears suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. Any effect that ends the Poisoned|XPHB condition condition neutralizes this poison. If the poison hasn't been neutralized before midnight, the creature makes a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (9d6 damage) Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
