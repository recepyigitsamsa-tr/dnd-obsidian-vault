## Description

This striking satin jacket allows you to make the most of your dying moments. When you drop to 0 hit points while wearing this doublet, you do not fall unconscious condition. Instead, you are incapacitated condition and your speed becomes 0, but you can speak and communicate.

You make death {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1} as normal, but if you roll a 1 on the {@dice d20}, you swoon with a loud gasp and die instantly.
