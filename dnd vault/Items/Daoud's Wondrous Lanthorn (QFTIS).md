## Description

This artifact destroys wealth to provide light and protection. Wrought from the finest yellow gold, the lantern has four faces, and an unwavering amber flame burns within it. The faces of the lantern are fitted with faceted gemstone lenses.

The lantern is a symbol of the teachings of Daoud, who was once a priest of Istus, a god of fate. When Daoud was stripped of his possessions, he developed a radical new philosophy in his quest to understand fate. He urged followers of his ideology to eschew wealth and seek out all fortunes, good and ill, to unravel the cloth of destiny.

### Random Properties

The lantern has the following random properties:

### Precious Fuel

The lantern burns only one source of fuel: powdered gemstones placed in the lantern's base. The lantern can hold a maximum of 10,000 gp worth of powdered gems, and it contains 9,000 gp of fuel when found. Thereafter it attempts to burn 100 gp of fuel after each year passes, keeping the lantern burning for another year. If no fuel is available, the lantern's flame goes out. You can add more fuel to the lantern as part of a short or long rest. Once added, fuel can't be removed from the lantern's base.

The lantern's flame can't be extinguished by any means other than running out of fuel. If the lantern's flame goes out, the creature attuned to it immediately dies. One exception to this rule exists (see the "Destroying the Lantern" section).

### Revealing Light

The lantern sheds {@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light} in a 60-foot radius and {@quickref Vision and Light||2||dim light} for an additional 60 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible while in the lantern's {@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light}.

While attuned to the lantern, you can use a bonus action to dim the lantern, reducing the light to {@quickref Vision and Light||2||dim light} in a 5-foot radius, or brighten the lantern back to its normal {@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light} radius.

### Lenses

When found, the lantern's faces display the following gem lenses: diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire. As part of a short or long rest, you can magically change any of these gem lenses to a different type of gem shown in the Lenses table. The gem lenses can't be removed from the lantern.

As an action while holding the lantern, you can burn some of the lantern's fuel to cast a spell (save DC 20 Saving Throw) through one or more of its current gem lenses, as noted in the Lenses table. The spell's target or point of origin must be in the lantern's area of {@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light}. If there isn't enough fuel left to cast the spell, the last of the remaining fuel is expended, and the flame goes out.

### Destroying the Lantern

To destroy the lantern, the creature attuned to it must forsake all material possessions except for the lantern and common clothes. Then the creature must willingly snuff the lantern's flame with the intention to destroy the artifact. When its flame is snuffed in this way, the lantern's gold corrodes, the lenses and remaining gemstone fuel turn to worthless sand, and the creature attuned to it is spared.
