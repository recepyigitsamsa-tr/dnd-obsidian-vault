## Description

This blue pennant is crafted from silk and is five feet long and whips about as if buffeted by a wind. The vind (wind) rune appears on its surface, looking almost like a cloud. The pennant has the following properties, which work only while it's on your person.

### Wind Step

As an action, you fly up to 20 feet. If you don't land at the end of this flight, you fall unless you have another means of staying aloft.

### Comforting Wind

You can't suffocate.

### Winds Grasp

As a reaction when you fall, you can cause yourself to take no damage from the fall. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Wind Walker

While you are attuned to this rune, you can cast levitate spell as a bonus action. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Gift of Wind

You can transfer the pennant's magic to a nonmagical item—a suit of armor, a pair of boots, or a cloak—by tracing the vind rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the pennant is destroyed, and the rune appears in silver on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:
