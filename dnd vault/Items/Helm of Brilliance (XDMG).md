## Description

This helm is set with {@dice 1d10} diamonds, {@dice 2d10} rubies, {@dice 3d10} fire opals, and {@dice 4d10} opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.

You gain the following benefits while wearing the helm.

### Diamond Light

As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits a 30-foot {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation}. When at least one Undead is within that area, the {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} is filled with {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB}. Any Undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 damage Radiant damage.

### Fire Opal Flames

As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit {@variantrule Bright Light|XPHB} in a 10-foot radius and {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage Fire damage. The flames last until you take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to extinguish them or until you drop or stow the weapon.

### Ruby Resistance

As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to Fire damage.

### Spells

You can cast one of the following spells (save DC 18 Saving Throw), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: Daylight|XPHB spell (opal), Fireball|XPHB spell (fire opal), Prismatic Spray|XPHB spell (diamond), or Wall of Fire|XPHB spell (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.

### Taking Fire Damage

Roll {@dice 1d20} if you are wearing the helm and take Fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems and is then destroyed. Each creature within a 60-foot {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} originating from you must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking Radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm.
