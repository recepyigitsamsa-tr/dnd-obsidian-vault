## Description

The design of this bronze circlet resembles swirling clouds. At its center is set a deep-blue stone, upon which is inscribed the cloud rune.

While wearing this circlet, you take no damage from falling. Additionally, as a bonus action, you and everything you are wearing or carrying can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of yourself, reappearing in a puff of shimmering clouds.

### Invoking the Rune

As an action, you can invoke the circlet's rune to assume a cloudlike form. The form lasts for 1 minute, until you are incapacitated, or until you dismiss it (no action required).

While in cloud form, you have a flying speed of 60 feet and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.
