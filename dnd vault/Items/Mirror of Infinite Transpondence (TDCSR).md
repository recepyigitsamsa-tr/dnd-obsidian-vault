## Description

These silver hand mirrors always come in pairs. When activated as an action, a mirror establishes a visual link with its paired mirror for 10 minutes, with the two mirrors acting as opposite sides of the same open window. The mirrors create this connection even if both are on different planes.

When a single mirror of infinite transpondence is found, the GM decides where its paired mirror is and who possesses it. A random possessor and location can be determined by rolling on the table below. Named bearers are described in _chapter 2_.

Once the connection between the two mirrors has been activated three times from either end, it can't be activated again until the next dawn.
