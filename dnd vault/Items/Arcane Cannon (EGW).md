## Description

This Large cannon is imbued with magic. It requires no ammunition and doesn't need to be loaded. It takes one action to aim the cannon and one action to fire it. After the cannon has fired, it must recharge for 5 minutes before it can be fired again.

The creature firing the cannon chooses the effect from the following options:

### Acid Jet

The cannon discharges acid in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10 damage) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 11 (2d10 damage) acid damage at the start of each of its turns; a creature can end this damage by using its action to wash off the acid with a pint or more of water.

### Fire Jet

The cannon discharges fire in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10 damage) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

### Frost Shot

The cannon shoots a ball of frost to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The ball then expands to form a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10 damage) cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn't reduced. A creature whose speed is reduced by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Lightning Shot

The cannon shoots a ball of lightning to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The lightning then expands to form a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10 damage) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the save.

### Poison Spray

The cannon expels poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10 damage) poison damage and is poisoned condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned condition. A creature poisoned condition in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
