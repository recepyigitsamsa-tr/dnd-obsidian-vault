## Description

A creature subjected to Pale Tincture must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6 damage) Poison damage and have the Poisoned|XPHB condition condition. The Poisoned|XPHB condition creature repeats the save every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6 damage) Poison damage on a failed save. The damage the poison deals can't be healed by any means while the creature remains Poisoned|XPHB condition. After seven successful saves against the poison, the creature is no longer Poisoned|XPHB condition.
