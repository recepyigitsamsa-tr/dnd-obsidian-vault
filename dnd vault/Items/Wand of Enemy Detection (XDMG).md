## Description

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to expend 1 charge. For 1 minute, you know the direction of the nearest creature {@variantrule Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB|Hostile} to you within 60 feet, but not its distance from you. The wand can sense the presence of {@variantrule Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB|Hostile} creatures that are Invisible|XPHB condition, ethereal, disguised, or hidden, as well as those in plain sight. The effect ends if you stop holding the wand.

### Regaining Charges

The wand regains {@dice 1d6 + 1} expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll {@dice 1d20}. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
