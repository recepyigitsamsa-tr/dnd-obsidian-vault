## Description

This crystal ball is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell spell (save DC 17 Saving Throw) with it.

You can use an action to cast the detect thoughts spell spell (save DC 17 Saving Throw) while you are scrying spell with the crystal ball, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this detect thoughts spell to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if scrying spell ends.
