## Description

This rod ends in three rubbery tentacles. While holding the rod, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to direct the tentacles to stretch outward, each one attacking a creature you can see within 15 feet of yourself. For each tentacle, make a melee attack roll with a +9 bonus. A tentacle deals 1d6 damage Psychic damage on a hit. If you hit the same target with all three tentacles, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained|XPHB condition condition until you have the Incapacitated|XPHB condition condition, until you take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to release the target, or until the target is no longer within 15 feet of you. While Restrained|XPHB condition in this way, the target takes 3d6 damage Psychic damage at the start of each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
