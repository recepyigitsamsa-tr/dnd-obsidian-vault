## Description

The sheer amount of leftover arcane power within the whitestone of the _Alabaster Sierra_ mountains is incredibly receptive to enchantment. Magic items that incorporate at least an ounce of whitestone into their construction require only one-quarter the creation time of other magic items. Some alchemists in _Emon_ have discovered that dissolving whitestone with specific acids can leave behind pure residuum|TDCSR, which can substitute for expensive spell components when such materials are not readily available.
