## Description

These steel crossbow bolt|PHB|crossbow bolts were first created by the Jaggenstrike Clan during the _Scattered War_, and the secret to crafting them remains well guarded by the _Houses of Kraghammer_. Cataclysm bolts are usually kept in sets of ten, though anyone who holds even one can feel it thrumming with magical power. When you hit with an attack using a cataclysm bolt, the attack deals normal damage. Then roll a {@dice d6} on the following table to determine its additional effect.

Once the bolt hits, the enchantment ends and it becomes a normal piece of ammunition.
