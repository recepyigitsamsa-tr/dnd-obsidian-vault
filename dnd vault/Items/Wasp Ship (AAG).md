## Description

Wasp ships are lightweight wooden vessels capable of landing safely on the ground, but not on water. They appeal to adventurers because they're affordable and don't require a large crew. Pirates like them because they're swift. Aristocrats are fond of using them as flying yachts because the ship's cargo hold can be easily converted into posh living quarters.

The ship's raised back provides high ground for a weapon emplacement, which is typically equipped with a ballista.
