## Description

This ring has 6 charges. While you wear it, you can expend 1 of its charges to project your voice to be heard clearly by all creatures within 1 mile of yourself, regardless of intervening noise, for 1 minute. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks this projection. If you project your voice while speaking a language the listening creatures don't understand, you can make the creatures understand what you're saying. You must be able to see the creatures to make them understand. The ring regains {@dice 1d6} expended charges daily at dawn.
