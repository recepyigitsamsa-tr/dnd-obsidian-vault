## Description

This small stylized key plays a vital role in the work of House Kundarak. If you cast the alarm spell, arcane lock spell, or glyph of warding spell spell, you can tie the effect to the keycharm so that whoever holds it receives the notification from the alarm spell spell, bypasses the lock of the arcane lock spell spell, or avoids triggering the glyph placed by the glyph of warding spell spell. In addition, the holder (who needn't be attuned to the item) can take an action to end any one spell tied to it, provided the holder knows the command word you set for ending the tied spells. The keycharm can have up to three tied spells at one time.
