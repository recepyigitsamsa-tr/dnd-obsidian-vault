## Description

You can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. Each spirit uses the Berserker|XMM stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}. The spirits look like living, breathing warriors, and they have {@variantrule Immunity|XPHB} to the Charmed|XPHB condition and Frightened|XPHB condition conditions. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

A silver horn summons 2 Berserker|XMM|Berserkers. They are {@variantrule Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB|Friendly} to you and your allies and follow your commands.
