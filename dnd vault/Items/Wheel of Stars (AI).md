## Description

While attuned to this device, you have a +1 bonus to Wisdom saving throws, and you can use an action to cast the dancing lights spell, guidance spell, or message spell cantrips.

### Portent of the Stars

As a reaction when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you make that creature roll a {@dice d10} and add or subtract the number rolled (your choice) from the roll. Once you use this feature of the wheel of stars, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

### Alter Gravity

As an action, you can cast fly spell on yourself or you can cast levitate spell (save DC 15 Saving Throw). Once you use this feature of the wheel of stars, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

### Part of a Whole

While this component is not installed in the Orrery of the Wanderer|AI, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.
