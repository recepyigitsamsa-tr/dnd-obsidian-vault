## Description

As an action, you can brandish this card at one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw, or it vanishes, transported to a prison on another plane of existence. After 1 minute, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
