## Description

When you drink this potion, it removes any Exhaustion|XPHB condition levels you have and ends the Poisoned|XPHB condition condition on you. For the next 24 hours, you regain the maximum number of {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} for any {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB|Hit Point} Die you spend.

This potion's crimson liquid regularly pulses with dull light, calling to mind a heartbeat.
