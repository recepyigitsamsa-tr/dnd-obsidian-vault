## Description

As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can turn the head of this staff into that of an animate, venomous snake for 1 minute or revert the staff to its inanimate form.

When you take the {@action Attack|XPHB} action, you can make one of the attack rolls using the animated snake head, which has a reach of 5 feet. Apply your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus} and Wisdom modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 damage Piercing damage and 3d6 damage Poison damage.

The snake head can be attacked while it is animate. It has AC 15, HP 20, and {@variantrule Immunity|XPHB} to Poison and Psychic damage. If the head drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, the staff is destroyed. As long as it's not destroyed, the staff regains all lost {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} when it reverts to its inanimate form.
