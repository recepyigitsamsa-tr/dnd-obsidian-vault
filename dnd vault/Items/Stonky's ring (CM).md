## Description

While wearing this ring, you can cast the telekinesis spell spell at will, but you can target only objects that aren't being worn or carried.

Any character who attunes to the ring gains control of Stonky's creations, though the skitterwidget|cm|skitterwidgets ignore commands spoken more than 30 feet away from them.
