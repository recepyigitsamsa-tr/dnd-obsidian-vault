## Description

Each time you make an attack roll with this magic weapon and hit, you can have it deal Lightning damage instead of Piercing damage.

### Lightning Bolt

When you throw this weapon at a target no farther than 120 feet from you, you can forgo making a ranged attack roll and instead turn the weapon into a bolt of lightning. This bolt forms a 5-foot-wide {@variantrule Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Line} between you and the target. The target and each other creature in the {@variantrule Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Line} (excluding you) makes a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 damage Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Immediately after dealing this damage, the weapon reappears in your hand. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
