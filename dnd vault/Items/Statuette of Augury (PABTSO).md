## Description

This gold statuette of an elf is worth 100 gp, and is imbued with divination magic. A non-evil creature grasping the statue can ask it a question and receive a telepathic response, as though the creature had cast augury spell. Once a creature has asked its question and received a response, it can never activate the statuette again.
