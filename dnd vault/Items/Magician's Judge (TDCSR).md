## Description

An executioner's blade from the _Age of Arcanum_, this magic greatsword|PHB is one of many similar weapons once used to execute magic-wielding criminals. Though most commonly found in the lands now known as _Wildemount_ and _Issylra_, a few such blades have found their way to Tal'Dorei.

If you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can cast the dispel magic spell spell from the sword against the target as part of the attack. Alternatively, you can use an action to cast dispel magic spell from the sword against a target of your choice. If you need to make a check with your spellcasting ability modifier as part of casting the spell, you make this check with a +3 modifier or your own spellcasting ability modifier, whichever is higher.

Once you cast dispel magic spell using this weapon, you can't do so again until the next dawn.
