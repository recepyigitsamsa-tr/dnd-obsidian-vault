## Description

While worn, the helm allows its wearer to use an action to cast the levitate spell spell, requiring no components. The helm's propeller spins and whirs loudly until the spell ends. Each time the spell ends, there is a {@chance 50} chance that the helm loses its magic and becomes nonmagical.
