## Description

This copper-hued helm contains a shard of the Elemental Chaos embedded in its forehead, surrounded by a motif of a rising sun. Legend says Annam fashioned this helm for his daughter Diancastra to hold the fragment of chaos she used to prove her worth to her father.

### Random Properties

The helm has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the Dungeon Master's Guide:

### Master of Guile

While wearing the helm, you have advantage on Charisma ({@skill Deception}) and Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) checks.

### Arrow of Elemental Havoc

As a bonus action while wearing the helm, you can launch a bolt of searing elemental energy toward a creature you can see within 90 feet of yourself. The target must make a DC 20 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d6 damage acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

### Spellcasting

The helm has 6 charges and regains {@dice 1d6} charges each dawn. As an action while wearing the helm, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 20 Saving Throw): elemental weapon spell (1 charge), call lightning spell (2 charges), wall of fire spell (3 charges), conjure elemental spell (4 charges), tsunami spell (5 charges).
