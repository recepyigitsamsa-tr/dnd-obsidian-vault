## Description

This beaded jade necklace bears an ancient symbol of the River Heralds. When worn, the primal amulet allows its wearer to cast speak with animals spell, locate object spell, and pass without trace spell. Once the amulet has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
