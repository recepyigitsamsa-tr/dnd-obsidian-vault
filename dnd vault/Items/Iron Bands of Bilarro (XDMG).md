## Description

This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.

Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus}. On a hit, the target has the Restrained|XPHB condition condition until you take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to issue a command that releases it. Doing so or missing with the attack causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.

A creature that can touch the bands, including the one Restrained|XPHB condition, can take an action to make a DC 20 Saving Throw Strength ({@skill Athletics|XPHB}) check to break the iron bands. On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the Restrained|XPHB condition creature is freed. On a failed check, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.

Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.
