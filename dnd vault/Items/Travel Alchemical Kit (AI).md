You gain proficiency with a poisoner's kit|phb as part of this upgrade.

You can use this magical kit as long as it is on your person, with no need to draw or stow it. If you are ever searched, finding your travel alchemical kit requires a successful DC 20 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) or Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check.
