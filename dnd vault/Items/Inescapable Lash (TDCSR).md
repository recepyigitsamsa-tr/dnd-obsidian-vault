## Description

This braided cord is dull bronze in color, ends in a splayed set of three barbs, and gleams like metal under any light. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has a reach of 20 feet. When you hit a creature or object using this whip, you can attempt to {@action grapple} the target as a bonus action.

While you have a creature grappled condition using this whip, you can use your action to either pull the creature up to 20 feet toward you, or cause the creature to be restrained condition until you let go of the whip. A creature restrained condition in this way can escape by making a successful Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check as an action. The DC of this check equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.
