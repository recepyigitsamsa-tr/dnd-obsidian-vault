## Description

This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast Dimension Door|XPHB spell as a {@action Magic|XPHB} action. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

When you teleport with that spell, you leave behind a cloud of smoke. The space you left is {@variantrule Lightly Obscured|XPHB} by that smoke until the end of your next turn.
