## Description

While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast dancing lights spell and light spell from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the ring requires an action.

The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring regains {@dice 1d6} expended charges daily at dawn.

### Faerie Fire

You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast faerie fire spell from the ring.

### Ball Lightning

You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.

Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.

As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created. (4 spheres = 2d4 damage, 3 spheres = 2d6 damage, 2 spheres = 5d4 damage, 1 sphere = 4d12 damage)

### Shooting Stars

You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 damage fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
