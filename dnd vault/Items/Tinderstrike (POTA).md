## Description

A flint dagger, Tinderstrike is uncommonly sharp, and sparks cascade off its edge whenever it strikes something solid. Its handle is always warm to the touch, and the blade smolders for {@dice 1d4} minutes after it is used to deal damage. It contains a spark of Imix|PotA, Prince of Evil Fire.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra 2d6 damage fire damage.

### Fire Mastery

You gain the following benefits while you hold Tinderstrike:

### Dance of the All-Consuming Fire

While inside a fire node, you can perform a ritual called the Dance of the All-Consuming Fire, using Tinderstrike to create a devastation orb of fire|PotA. Once you perform the ritual, Tinderstrike can't be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

### Flaw

Tinderstrike makes its wielder impatient and rash. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I act without thinking and take risks without weighing the consequences."
