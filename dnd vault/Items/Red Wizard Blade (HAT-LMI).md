## Description

Forged by Red Wizards using a secret process known only to them, this grim steel dagger draws its power from the Negative Plane. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using this magic dagger, the target takes an extra 3d12 damage necrotic damage.

A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this weapon dies and can't be raised from the dead except by a deity or by a creature using a tablet of reawakening|HAT-LMI to cast the true resurrection spell spell.
