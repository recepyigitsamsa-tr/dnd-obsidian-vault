## Description

This massive adze is said to have been wielded by All-Father Annam, not as a weapon but as the tool he used to shape the various worlds of the Material Plane eons ago.

### Random Properties

The adze has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the Dungeon Master's Guide:

### Magic Weapon

When a creature attunes to the adze, the artifact magically adjusts its size so that creature can wield it as a greataxe. The adze is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. On a hit, the adze deals an additional 3d12 damage force damage. It also deals double damage to objects and structures.

### Divine Mattock

As an action, you can call upon the might of the All-Father and use the adze to cast move earth spell or fabricate spell. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
