## Description

This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to expend 1 charge and create orchestral music by waving it around. The music can be heard out to 120 feet and ends when you stop waving the wand.

### Regaining Charges

The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll {@dice 1d20}. On a 1, a sad tuba sound plays as the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
