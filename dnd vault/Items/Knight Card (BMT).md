## Description

As an action, you can throw this card to an unoccupied space on the ground within 60 feet of yourself while speaking a command word, whereupon the card magically transforms into a deck defender|BMT (see _chapter 9_ for its stat block) for up to 1 minute or until you use an action to speak the command word again, whereupon it transforms back into a card. The deck defender obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, it takes the {@action Dodge} action and moves to avoid danger. The deck defender reverts to a card early if it drops to 0 hit points. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
