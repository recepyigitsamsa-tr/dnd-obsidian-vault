## Description

When you drink a potion of mind control, you can cast a dominate spell (save DC 15 Saving Throw) on a specific creature if you do so before the end of your next turn. If you don't, the potion is wasted.

A potion of mind control produces the effect of a dominate monster spell spell. If the target's initial saving throw fails, the effect lasts for 1 hour, with no {@status concentration} required on your part. The charmed condition creature has disadvantage on new saving throws to break the effect during this time.
