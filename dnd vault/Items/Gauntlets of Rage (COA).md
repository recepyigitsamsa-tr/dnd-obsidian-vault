## Description

You gain the power of never-ending fury. After you make a melee weapon attack, you automatically enter a special fury for 1 minute. While furious, you can't cast spells, can't verbally communicate, and are immune to the charmed condition and frightened condition conditions. Each time you deal damage, you regain {@dice 2d8} hit points and may immediately remove a condition you currently suffer from or end this fury. Additionally, while in this fury, you may spend a spell slot before you make a melee attack. Doing so causes the attack to deal an extra 3 (1d6 damage) necrotic damage per level of spell slot expended, if the attack hits. Once used you may not use this fury again until you finish a short or long rest.
