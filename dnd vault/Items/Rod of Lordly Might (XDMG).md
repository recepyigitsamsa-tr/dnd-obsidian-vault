## Description

This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.

### Buttons

You can press one of the following buttons as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}; a button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form:

### Drain Life

When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an extra 4d6 damage Necrotic damage, and you regain a number of {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} equal to half that Necrotic damage. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Paralyze

When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Paralyzed|XPHB condition condition for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Terrify

While holding the rod, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself to make a DC 17 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target has the Frightened|XPHB condition condition for 1 minute. A Frightened|XPHB condition target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
