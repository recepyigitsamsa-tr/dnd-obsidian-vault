## Description

This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.

The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is susceptible to damage from a Sphere of Annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 8d10 damage Force damage.

### Controlling the Sphere

A Sphere of Annihilation is stationary until someone takes control of it. If you are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to make a DC 25 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Arcana|XPHB}) check. On a successful check, you control the sphere until the start of your next turn, and if it was under another creature's control, that creature loses control of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you in a straight line.

While in control of the sphere, you can take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to cause it to move in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 19 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 8d10 damage Force damage. A creature reduced to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} by this damage is obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no other physical remains.

### Sphere Interactions

If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal (such as that created by the Gate|XPHB spell spell) or an extradimensional space (such as that within a Portable Hole), the DM determines randomly what happens using the following table.
