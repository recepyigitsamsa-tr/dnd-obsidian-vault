## Description

Black, blue, green, red, and white gems carved in the form of dragon heads cover this ostentatious gold war pick, marking it as a weapon channeling the power of Tiamat.

### Sentience

Will of the Talon is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common, Draconic, and Infernal.

### Personality

A short-tempered bone devil named Ashtyrlon lives within Will of the Talon. The weapon is greedy and values strong leadership. It demands that its wielder take decisive action to keep order in high-pressure situationsâ€”and to always take a fair share of treasure in return.

### Dormant

The war pick grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

When you use the war pick to unleash a breath weapon of a specific damage type, you can't choose that same damage type again until the next dawn.

The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} property and one {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} property and an additional {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} property. See "Artifact Properties" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information.
