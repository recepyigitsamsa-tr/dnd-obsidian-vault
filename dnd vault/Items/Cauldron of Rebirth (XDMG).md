## Description

This Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its cast-iron sides.

You can use the cauldron as a {@variantrule Spellcasting Focus|XPHB} for your spells, and it functions as a suitable component for the Scrying|XPHB spell spell.

### Brew Potion

When you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, you can use the cauldron to create a Potion of Greater Healing|XDMG|Potion of Healing (greater), which takes 1 minute. The potion lasts for 24 hours, then loses its magic if not consumed.

### Raise Dead

As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you can cause the cauldron to grow large enough for a Medium creature to crouch within. You can revert the cauldron to its normal size as a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, harmlessly shunting anything that can't fit inside to the nearest unoccupied space.

If you place the corpse of a Humanoid into the cauldron and cover the corpse with 200 pounds of salt (which costs 10 GP) for at least 8 hours, the salt is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by Raise Dead|XPHB spell at the next dawn. Once used, this property can't be used again for 7 days.
