## Description

A Figurine of Wondrous Power|XDMG is a statuette small enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a living creature specified in the figurine's description below. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is {@variantrule Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB|Friendly} to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your {@variantrule Initiative|XPHB} count. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} or if you take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action while touching the creature to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified below.

### Obsidian Steed (Very Rare)

This polished obsidian horse can become a Nightmare|XMM for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

The figurine has a {@chance 10} chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.
