## Description

You gain a +2 bonus to {@variantrule Armor Class|XPHB} against ranged attack rolls while you wield this Shield. This bonus is in addition to the Shield's normal bonus to AC.

Whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack roll against a target within 5 feet of you, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to become the target of the attack instead.
