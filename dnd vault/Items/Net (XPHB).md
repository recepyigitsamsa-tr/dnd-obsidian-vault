## Description

When you take the {@action Attack|XPHB} action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing a Net. Target a creature you can see within 15 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 Saving Throw plus your Dexterity modifier and {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus}) or have the Restrained|XPHB condition condition until it escapes. The target succeeds automatically if it is Huge or larger.

To escape, the target or a creature within 5 feet of it must take an action to make a DC 10 Saving Throw Strength ({@skill Athletics|XPHB}) check, freeing the Restrained|XPHB condition creature on a success. Destroying the Net (AC 10; 5 HP; {@variantrule Immunity|XPHB} to Bludgeoning, Poison, and Psychic damage) also frees the target, ending the effect.
