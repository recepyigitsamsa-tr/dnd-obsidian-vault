## Description

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the fireball spell spell (save DC 15 Saving Throw) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

The wand regains {@dice 1d6 + 1} expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
