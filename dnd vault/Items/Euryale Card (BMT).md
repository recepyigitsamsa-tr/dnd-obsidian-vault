## Description

As an action, you can brandish this card at one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and attempt to turn it to stone. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, or it begins to turn to stone and has the restrained condition condition. The affected target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends on the target. On a failed save, the target has the petrified condition condition (instead of the restrained condition condition) until it is removed by the Greater Restoration spell spell or similar magic. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
