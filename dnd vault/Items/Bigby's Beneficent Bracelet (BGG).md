## Description

This gorgeous jewelry piece, crafted by the wizard Bigby himself, consists of four gold rings attached via delicate chains to a wrist cuff studded with sapphires and diamonds.

### Random Properties

The bracelet has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the Dungeon Master's Guide:

### Dexterous Fingers

While wearing the bracelet, you can cast mage hand spell.

### Force Sculpture

By focusing and channeling the bracelet's magic for 1 minute, you can create a spectral copy of a Large or smaller nonmagical object. The copy appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, and it is made of tangible but translucent force that mimics the size, weight, and other properties of the object it's copying. The copy must appear on a surface or liquid that can support it. Creatures can touch and interact with the copy as if it were a nonmagical object.

The copy is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled, but a disintegrate spell spell destroys it immediately. Otherwise, the copy disappears after 8 hours or when you dismiss it as an action.

The bracelet can create up to three copies and regains all expended uses at dawn.

### Helpful Hand

As an action, you can use the bracelet to cast Bigby's hand spell as a 9th-level spell (spell attack bonus +13). When you cast the spell this way, the spell doesn't require {@status concentration}. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
