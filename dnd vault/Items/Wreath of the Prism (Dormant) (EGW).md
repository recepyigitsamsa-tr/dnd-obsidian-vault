## Description

This loop of golden thorns is inset with dozens of gems representing the five colors of Tiamat.

### Dormant

While wearing the wreath in its dormant state, you have {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have {@sense darkvision}, wearing the wreath increases the range of your {@sense darkvision} by 60 feet.

When you hit a beast, dragon, or monstrosity of challenge rating 5 or lower with an attack, or when you grapple it, you can use the wreath to cast dominate monster spell on the creature (save DC 13 Saving Throw). On a successful save, the target is immune to the power of the wreath for 24 hours. On a failure, a shimmering, golden image of the wreath appears as a collar around the target's neck or as a crown on its head (your choice) until it is no longer charmed condition by the spell. If you use the wreath to charm a second creature, the first spell immediately ends. When the spell ends, the target knows it was charmed condition by you.
