## Description

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with Oil of Slipperiness|XDMG. When found, a container contains {@dice 1d6 + 1} ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. Applying an ounce of Sovereign Glue takes a {@action Utilize|XPHB} action, and the applied glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of Universal Solvent or Oil of Etherealness|XDMG, or with a Wish|XPHB spell spell.
