## Description

While holding this Shield, you can take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to cause it to animate. The Shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The Shield remains animate for 1 minute, until you take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to end this effect, or until you die or have the Incapacitated|XPHB condition condition, at which point the Shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free.
