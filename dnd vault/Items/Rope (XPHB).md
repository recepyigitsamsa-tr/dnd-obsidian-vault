## Description

As a {@action Utilize|XPHB} action, you can tie a knot with Rope if you succeed on a DC 10 Saving Throw Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand|XPHB}) check. The Rope can be burst with a successful DC 20 Saving Throw Strength ({@skill Athletics|XPHB}) check.

You can bind an unwilling creature with the Rope only if the creature has the Grappled|XPHB condition, Incapacitated|XPHB condition, or Restrained|XPHB condition condition. If the creature's legs are bound, the creature has the Restrained|XPHB condition condition until it escapes. Escaping the Rope requires the creature to make a successful DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics|XPHB}) check as an action.
