## Description

While you are within 5 feet of this brazier, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to summon a Fire Elemental|XMM. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the brazier as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your {@variantrule Initiative|XPHB} count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}. The brazier can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
