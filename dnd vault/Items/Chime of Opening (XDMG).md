## Description

This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound. As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you can strike the chime to cast Knock|XPHB spell. The spell's customary knocking sound is replaced by the clear, ringing tone of the chime, which is audible out to 300 feet. The chime can be used 10 times. After the tenth time, it cracks and becomes useless.
