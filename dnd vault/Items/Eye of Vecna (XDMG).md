## Description

_Vecna_ was a mighty wizard who, through magic and conquest, forged a terrible empire. For all his power, however, Vecna feared death and took steps to prevent his demise by becoming a lich.

A treacherous lieutenant named Kas brought Vecna's rule to an end in a terrible battle. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly Artifacts that still seek to work Vecna's will in the world.

The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna|XDMG are separate Artifacts that might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a shriveled left extremity.

### Random Properties of the Eye and Hand

The Eye of Vecna has the following random properties:

### Attuning to the Eye

To attune to the eye, you must press it into your empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. If the eye is ever removed, you die.

### Properties of the Eye

While you are attuned to the eye, your alignment is Neutral Evil, and you gain the following benefits:

### Destroying the Eye and Hand

If the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna|XDMG are both attached to the same creature and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas|XDMG, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the Artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.
