## Description

While you are playing this musical instrument|XPHB, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to create harmless, illusory visual effects within a 5-foot {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} originating from the instrument. If you are a Bard, the size of the {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} increases to 15 feet. Sample visual effects include luminous musical notes, a spectral dancer, butterflies, and gently falling snow. The magical effects have neither substance nor sound, and they are obviously illusory. The effects end when you stop playing.
