## Description

While wearing this cloak, you have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth|XPHB}) checks. In an area of {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} or {@variantrule Darkness|XPHB}, you can grip the edges of the cloak and use it to gain a {@variantrule Fly Speed|XPHB} of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak's edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} or {@variantrule Darkness|XPHB}, you lose this {@variantrule Fly Speed|XPHB}.

While wearing the cloak in an area of {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} or {@variantrule Darkness|XPHB}, you can cast Polymorph|XPHB spell on yourself, shape-shifting into a Bat|XMM. While in that form, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
