## Description

An ornate carving of a serpent adorned with a coursing river spirals down the length of this redand-gold staff. While you're holding it, you can use an action to produce one of the following effects. Once the staff has produced an effect, it can't produce that effect again until the next dawn.

### Orb of Lightning

You create a Small orb of lightning in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of yourself. You concentrate on this orb as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell. As a bonus action, you can move the orb up to 20 feet in any direction.

When your {@status concentration} ends, or when a creature enters the orb's space or starts its turn there, the orb detonates in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking lightning damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one; the orb's base damage is 6d6 damage, and if at the end of your turn the orb hasn't detonated, its damage increases by 2d6 damage, to a maximum of 10d6 damage.

### Staff to Snake

You throw the staff to an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, and the staff becomes a giant poisonous snake. The snake is under your control and shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours.

On your turn, you can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet of you and you don't have the incapacitated condition condition. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.

If you use a bonus action to speak the command word again, or if the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, the snake reverts to staff form in its current space.

### Thunderclap

You point the staff skyward, producing a fearsome thunderclap. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on you must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or have the deafened condition and frightened condition conditions until the end of your next turn.
