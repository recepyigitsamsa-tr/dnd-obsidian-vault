## Description

Every few years, a ghost orchid colony grows a black pod as thick as a human fist that holds three soft, black seeds. A creature that consumes one of these black seeds is affected by the spell feign death spell. If the creature is unaware of the pod's effects or does not wish to be affected, it can resist the effect by succeeding on a DC 16 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. Otherwise, it is considered to be a willing recipient of the spell.
