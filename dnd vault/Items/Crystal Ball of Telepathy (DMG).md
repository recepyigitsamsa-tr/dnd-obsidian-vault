## Description

This crystal ball is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell spell (save DC 17 Saving Throw) with it.

While scrying spell with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the suggestion spell spell (save DC 17 Saving Throw) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this suggestion to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if scrying spell ends. Once used, the suggestion power of the crystal ball can't be used again until the next dawn.
