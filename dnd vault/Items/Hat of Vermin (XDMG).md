## Description

This hat has 3 charges. While holding the hat, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to expend 1 charge and summon your choice of a Bat|XMM, a Frog|XMM, or a Rat|XMM. The summoned creature magically appears in the hat and tries to get away from you as quickly as possible. The creature is {@variantrule Indifferent [Attitude]|XPHB|Indifferent} toward you and other creatures, and it isn't under your control. It behaves as an ordinary creature of its kind and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}. The hat regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
