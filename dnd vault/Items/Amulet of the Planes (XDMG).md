## Description

While wearing this amulet, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Arcana|XPHB}) check. On a successful check, you cast Plane Shift|XPHB spell. On a failed check, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination determined by rolling {@dice 1d100} and consulting the following table.
