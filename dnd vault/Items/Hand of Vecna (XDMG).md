## Description

_Vecna_ was a mighty wizard who, through magic and conquest, forged a terrible empire. For all his power, however, Vecna feared death and took steps to prevent his demise by becoming a lich.

A treacherous lieutenant named Kas brought Vecna's rule to an end in a terrible battle. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly Artifacts that still seek to work Vecna's will in the world.

The Eye of Vecna|XDMG and the Hand of Vecna are separate Artifacts that might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a shriveled left extremity.

### Random Properties of the Eye and Hand

The Hand of Vecna has the following random properties:

### Attuning to the Hand

To attune to the hand, you must press it against the stump where your left hand was. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.

### Properties of the Hand

When you are attuned to the hand, your alignment is Neutral Evil, and you gain the following benefits:

### Destroying the Eye and Hand

If the Eye of Vecna|XDMG and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas|XDMG, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the Artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.
