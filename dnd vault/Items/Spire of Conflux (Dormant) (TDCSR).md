## Description

A powerful relic passed down from generation to generation of Ashari leaders, the Spire of Conflux was lost over three centuries ago when Joran the Sea-Speaker, a respected leader of _the Water Ashari_, was devoured by a demon of the Abyss. It was rediscovered by the legendary druid Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest|TDCSR|Keyleth of Zephrah, Voice of the Tempest.
