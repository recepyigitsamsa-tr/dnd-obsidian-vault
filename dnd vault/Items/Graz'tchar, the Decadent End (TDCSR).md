## Description

This blade appears to be a beautiful cruciform sword of shining silver, inlaid with sparkling rubies. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the following properties.

### Corrosive Submission

When you hit a creature that has an Intelligence score of 4 or higher with an attack using this sword, the target takes an extra 3d6 damage acid damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Charisma {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw} or be charmed condition by you for 1 hour. If you attack the creature again while it is charmed condition in this way, the extra acid damage increases to {@dice 10d6} and the charmed condition condition ends. If the target succeeds on its {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw} or the charm ends for it, it can't be charmed condition again in this way for 24 hours.

### Hidden Nature

The acid damage dealt by this greatsword appears to be radiant damage to all who perceive it. A true seeing spell spell or similar magic reveals that the sword is actually a rusted, pitted blade dripping with acid.

### Sentience

{@deity Graz'tchar|Exandria|TDCSR|Graz'tchar} is a sentient neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet.

The sword can speak, read, and understand {@language Common}, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Anyone who holds it hears the wise voice of a sorrowful king, beckoning the user to seize their destiny. A creature that succeeds on a DC 26 Saving Throw Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check while listening to the blade's voice hears a sliver of malice that suggests the truth: the voice is a corrupting trick of the Demon Prince of Indulgence.

### Personality

{@deity Graz'tchar|Exandria|TDCSR|Graz'tchar} slowly attempts to sway its wielder to sow chaos in Exandria, telling lies and spreading malign truths about great leaders, and claiming that the _members of the Tal'Dorei Council_ are corrupt and must be overthrown. The voice of this blade is actually the Demon Prince of Indulgence, speaking from his Abyssal prison.

If the sword's attuned wielder disobeys the urges of the weapon for an extended period of time, {@deity Graz'tchar|Exandria|TDCSR|Graz'tchar} can attempt to control the wielder, who must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Charisma {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw} or become charmed condition by the sword for 24 hours. While the wielder is charmed condition in this way, the sword can compel them to take an action of the sword's choice once per hour, though the wielder believes this action is taken of their own free will. If the chosen action leads to the harm of someone the wielder considers a trusted friend or ally, the charmed condition condition immediately ends. On a successful {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw} or if the charmed condition condition ends for the wielder, they are immune to this property of the sword for 24 hours.
