## Description

As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level area 10 feet square. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or fall prone condition. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw.
