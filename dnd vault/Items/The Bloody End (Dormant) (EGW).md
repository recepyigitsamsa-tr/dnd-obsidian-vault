## Description

Carrying the power of Bane, this adamantine morningstar sports foot-long spikes and has a jagged blade on its pommel.

### Sentience

The Bloody End is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal.

### Personality

A tyrannical pit fiend named Izeelzee lives within The Bloody End. The weapon boisterously pushes its wielder to subjugate others and to never back down from a challenge. If the wielder doesn't demand fealty from others, the weapon is happy to demand it on their behalf.

### Dormant

The morningstar grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} property and one {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial} property and an additional {@table Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental} property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a {@table Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial} property. See "Artifact Properties" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information.
