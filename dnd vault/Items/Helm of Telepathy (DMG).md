## Description

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the detect thoughts spell spell (save DC 13 Saving Throw) from it. As long as you maintain {@status concentration} on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with detect thoughts spell, you can use an action to cast the suggestion spell spell (save DC 13 Saving Throw) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the suggestion property can't be used again until the next dawn.
