## Description

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or become poisoned condition for 1 minute. The poisoned condition creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no other creature within its reach, the poisoned condition creature does nothing on its turn. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
