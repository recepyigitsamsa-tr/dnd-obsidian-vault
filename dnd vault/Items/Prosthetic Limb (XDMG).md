## Description

This magic item replaces a lost limbâ€”a hand, an arm, a foot, a leg, or a similar body part. While the prosthetic is attached, it functions identically to the part it replaces. You can detach or reattach it as a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, and it can't be removed against your will while you are alive.
