## Description

Found in a small container, this powder resembles Dust of Disappearance|XDMG, and Identify|XPHB spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

As a {@action Utilize|XPHB} action, you can throw the dust into the air, forcing yourself and every creature in a 30-foot {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} originating from you to make a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. Constructs, Elementals, Oozes, Plants, and Undead succeed on the save automatically.

On a failed save, a creature begins sneezing uncontrollably; it has the Incapacitated|XPHB condition condition and is suffocating. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect also ends on any creature targeted by a Lesser Restoration|XPHB spell spell.
