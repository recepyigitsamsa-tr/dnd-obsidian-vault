## Description

You can cast Dancing Lights|XPHB spell or Light|XPHB spell from the ring.

The ring has 6 charges and regains {@dice 1d6} expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend its charges to use the properties below.

### Faerie Fire

You can expend 1 charge to cast Faerie Fire|XPHB spell from the ring.

### Lightning Spheres

You can expend 2 charges as a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to create up to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning.

Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. The spheres last as long as you maintain {@status Concentration|XPHB}, up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} in a 30-foot radius.

As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from yourself. The first time the sphere comes within 5 feet of a creature other than you that isn't behind {@variantrule Cover|XPHB|Total Cover}, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature makes a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

### Shooting Stars

You can expend 1 to 3 charges as a {@action Magic|XPHB} action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each creature in a 15-foot {@variantrule Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cube} originating from that point is showered in sparks and makes a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 damage Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
