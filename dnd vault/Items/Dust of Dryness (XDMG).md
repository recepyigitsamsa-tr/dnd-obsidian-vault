## Description

This small packet contains {@dice 1d6 + 4} pinches of dust. As a {@action Utilize|XPHB} action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot {@variantrule Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cube} of water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible. A creature can take a {@action Utilize|XPHB} action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pellet and ends its magic.

As a {@action Utilize|XPHB} action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that is composed mostly of water (such as a Water Elemental|XMM or a Water Weird|XMM). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the dust makes a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 damage Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
