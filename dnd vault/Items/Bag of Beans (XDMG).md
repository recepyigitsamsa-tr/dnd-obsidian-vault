## Description

This heavy cloth bag contains {@dice 3d4} dry beans when found. The bag weighs half a pound regardless of how many beans it contains and becomes a nonmagical item when it no longer contains any beans.

If you dump one or more beans out of the bag, they explode in a 10-foot-radius {@variantrule Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Sphere} centered on them. All the dumped beans are destroyed in the explosion, and each creature in the {@variantrule Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Sphere}, including you, makes a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 damage Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean disappears as it produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The DM can choose an effect from the following table or determine it randomly.
