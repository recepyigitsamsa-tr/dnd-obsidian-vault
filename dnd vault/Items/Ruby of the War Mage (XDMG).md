## Description

Etched with eldritch runes, this 1-inch-diameter ruby allows you to use a Simple or Martial weapon as a {@variantrule Spellcasting Focus|XPHB} for your spells. For this property to work, you must attach the ruby to the weapon by pressing the ruby against it for at least 10 minutes. Thereafter, the ruby can't be removed unless you detach it as a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, the weapon is destroyed, or your {@variantrule Attunement|XPHB} to the ruby ends.
