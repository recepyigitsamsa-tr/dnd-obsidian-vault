## Description

While you wear these boots, you can take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to click the boots' heels together. If you do, the boots double your {@variantrule Speed|XPHB}, and any creature that makes an {@action Opportunity Attack|XPHB} against you has {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.

When you've used the boots' property for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function for you until you finish a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}.
