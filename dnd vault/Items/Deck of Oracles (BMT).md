## Description

The illustrations on this deck of oracle cards move or change subtly when viewed indirectly. When you finish a long rest, you can spend 10 minutes consulting the cards for an omen of the coming day. Roll a {@dice d20} and record the number rolled. Once in the next 8 hours, immediately after a creature within 60 feet of you makes an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to discard the {@dice d20} roll; the creature must use the number you rolled in place of its roll.

Additionally, while holding the cards, you can cast Divination spell from them. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
