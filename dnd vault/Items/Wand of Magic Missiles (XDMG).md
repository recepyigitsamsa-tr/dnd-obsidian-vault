## Description

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can expend no more than 3 charges to cast Magic Missile|XPHB spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the level 1 version of the spell. You can increase the spell's level by 1 for each additional charge you expend.

### Regaining Charges

The wand regains {@dice 1d6 + 1} expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll {@dice 1d20}. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
