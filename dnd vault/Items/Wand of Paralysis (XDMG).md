## Description

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to expend 1 charge to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or have the Paralyzed|XPHB condition condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Regaining Charges

The wand regains {@dice 1d6 + 1} expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll {@dice 1d20}. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
