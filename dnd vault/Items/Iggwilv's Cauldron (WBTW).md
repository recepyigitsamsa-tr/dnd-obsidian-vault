## Description

Iggwilv the Witch Queen|WBtW|Iggwilv crafted this wondrous cauldron with the help of her adoptive mother, the archfey Baba Yaga. The cauldron has two forms. Only Iggwilv or Baba Yaga can change the cauldron from one form to another (by using an action to touch it), which either can do without being attuned to the item. In its first form, the cauldron is made of solid gold and embossed on the outside with images of bare-branched trees, falling leaves, and broomsticks. In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakesâ€”eight of each animal. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds when empty, and it can hold up to 100 gallons of liquid.

### Attunement

Any Humanoid creature that attunes to the cauldron must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be aged to the point of decrepitude. In this state, the creature's speed is halved, the range of its vision and hearing is reduced to 30 feet, and it has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The creature will reach the end of its natural life span in {@dice 3d8} days. Only a wish spell spell or divine intervention can reverse this aging effect on the creature.

Three hags can attune to the cauldron simultaneously, provided they have formed a coven. If the coven disbands, the attunement ends for all three hags.

### Random Properties

Regardless of the form it takes, the cauldron has the following random properties:

### Gold Cauldron

The gold cauldron has the following properties:

### Iron Cauldron

The iron cauldron has the following properties:

### Destroying the Cauldron

The cauldron is a Medium object with AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to damage from any source other than a flame tongue or frost brand weapon. Reducing the cauldron to 0 hit points with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size, whereupon all ongoing effects created by the cauldron end as it loses its magic.

The destruction of Iggwilv's Cauldron causes all hags in the multiverse to lose the Shared Spellcasting trait gained by being in a coven (see the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the Monster Manual).

### Reconstructing the Cauldron

If all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a wish spell spell can reassemble them, restoring the cauldron and all its properties. The cauldron's reconstruction also restores the Shared Spellcasting trait of hag covens throughout the multiverse.

As explained in the description of Iggwilv's Cauldron, the poem titled "The Witch Queen's Cauldron" is an incantation that hints at the time-freezing property of the artifact:

Eight cats perch atop eight dead attending

Eight lizards flee from eight rats scavenging

Eight toads climbing meet eight dead and falling

Eight snakes sneak under eight bats screaming

Eight eyes open, always dreaming

All on the cauldron that is ever seeming
