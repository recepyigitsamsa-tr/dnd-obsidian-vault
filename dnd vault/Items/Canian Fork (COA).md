## Description

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, you can make one additional attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns.

### Curse

You're unwilling to part with this weapon while attuned to it. You're also vulnerable to radiant damage and each time you receive magical healing, you must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, the healing has no effect. Only the Remove Curse spell spell allows you to end attunement to this item.

### Corrupting
