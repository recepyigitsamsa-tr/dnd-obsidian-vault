## Description

This wooden staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of yourself, or from the staff itself. Unless you choose a specific kind of flower, the staff creates a mild-scented daisy. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal flower would.

### Regaining Charges

The staff regains {@dice 1d6 + 4} expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll {@dice 1d20}. On a 1, the staff turns into flower petals and is lost forever.
