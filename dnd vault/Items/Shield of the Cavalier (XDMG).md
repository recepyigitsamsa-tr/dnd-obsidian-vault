## Description

While holding this Shield, you have a +2 bonus to {@variantrule Armor Class|XPHB}. This bonus is in addition to the Shield's normal bonus to AC.

The Shield has the following additional properties that you can use while holding it.

### Forceful Bash

When you take the {@action Attack|XPHB}, you can make one of the attack rolls using the Shield against a target within 5 feet of yourself. Apply your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus} and Strength modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the Shield deals Force damage to the target equal to {@dice 2d6 + 2} plus your Strength modifier, and if the target is a creature, you can push it up to 10 feet directly away from yourself. If the creature is your size or smaller, you can also knock it down, giving it the Prone|XPHB condition condition.

### Protective Field

As a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB}, when you or an ally you can see within 5 feet of you is targeted by an attack or makes a saving throw against an area of effect, you can use the Shield to create an immobile 5-foot {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} originating from you. When the {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} appears, any creatures or objects not fully contained within it are pushed into the nearest unoccupied spaces outside it. The attack or area of effect that triggered the {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} has no effect on creatures and objects inside the {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation}, which lasts as long as you maintain {@status Concentration|XPHB}, up to 1 minute. Nothing can pass into or out of the {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation}. A creature or object inside the {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the {@variantrule Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Emanation} damage anything outside it. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
