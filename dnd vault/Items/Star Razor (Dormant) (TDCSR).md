## Description

The thick, grooved blade of this shining silver longsword|PHB is lined with etched runes that sparkle blue in the light. Star Razor—known also as Dwueth'var—was thought to have been destroyed or lost after the _Calamity_, but new rumors suggest that it might be wielded by a half-orc somewhere in _Wildemount_.

### Dormant

While Star Razor is in a dormant state, you can hold this magic longsword and use a bonus action to speak the command word {@i Galas-var}, causing the sword to emit a pale blue glow that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. This glow lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again, or until you drop or sheathe the sword.
