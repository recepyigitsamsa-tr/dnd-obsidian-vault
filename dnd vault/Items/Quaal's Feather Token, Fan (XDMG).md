## Description

This object looks like a feather.

If you are on a boat or ship, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as a {@action Magic|XPHB} action.
