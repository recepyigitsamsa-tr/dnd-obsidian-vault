## Description

This Tiny cube looks like a jack-in-the-box. When you wind its crank as a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, a merry tune emits from the box, the lid pops open, a creature appears in the nearest unoccupied space, and the lid closes. The lid can't otherwise be opened.

Roll on the Cube of Summoning|XDMG table to determine which spell the cube casts to summon the creature. The spell is cast at level 5 (save DC 17 Saving Throw, +9 attack bonus) and doesn't require {@status Concentration|XPHB}, but you otherwise function as the spell's caster.

Once the cube summons a creature, the cube can't do so again until the next dawn.
