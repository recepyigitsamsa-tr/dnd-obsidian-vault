## Description

While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a {@variantrule Climb Speed|XPHB} equal to your {@variantrule Speed|XPHB}. However, the slippers don't allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.
