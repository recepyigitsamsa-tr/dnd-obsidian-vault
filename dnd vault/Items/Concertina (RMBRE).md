## Description

A concertina is a less charming kind of accordion.

In addition to knocking out a killer polka, a creature playing the concertina can use an action to cause an area of mist or water up to 30 feet in diameter and 6 inches deep to freeze solid.

Once used, this feature of the concertina can't be used again until the next dawn.

Any creatures touching the floor must succeed on a DC 20 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or be restrained condition by the ice. As an action, a restrained condition creature can attempt to free itself or another creature within its reach from the ice, doing so with a successful DC 20 Saving Throw Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. A character freed from the ice is no longer restrained condition by it. The ice melts in an hour.
