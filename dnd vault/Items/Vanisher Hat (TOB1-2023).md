## Description

This plain hat appears to be a rough burlap tam. A creature that can see through illusions sees the hat as a golden, bejeweled coronet. While wearing this hat, you can use an action to speak its command word to become invisible and gain a flying speed of 40 feet for up to 1 minute. Anything you are wearing or carrying is invisible with you. You remain invisible and capable of flying until you repeat the command word as an action or until you attack or cast a spell. Once used, the hat can't be used again until the next dawn.
