As an action, you can light a Bomb and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius {@variantrule Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Sphere} centered on that point makes a DC 12 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 damage Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
