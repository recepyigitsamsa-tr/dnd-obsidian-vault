## Description

This fist-sized chunk of amethyst is infused with an amethyst dragon's ability to bend gravitational forces. While you are carrying the lodestone, you have advantage on Strength saving throws.

The lodestone has 6 charges for the following properties, which you can use while you are holding the stone. The stone regains {@dice 1d6} expended charges daily at dawn.

### Flight

As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to gain the power of flight for 10 minutes. For the duration, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can hover.

### Gravitational Thrust

As an action, you can expend 1 charge to focus gravity around a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet in a direction of your choice.

### Reverse Gravity

As an action, you can expend 3 charges to cast reverse gravity spell from the stone (save DC 18 Saving Throw).
