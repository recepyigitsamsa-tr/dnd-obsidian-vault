## Description

While holding this Shield, you have {@variantrule Resistance|XPHB} to damage from attacks made with Ranged weapons.

### Curse

This Shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by a Remove Curse|XPHB spell spell or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever an attack with a Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
