## Description

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear within 60 feet of you. These spirits use the berserker statistics. They return to Ysgard after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

A bronze horn summons {@dice 4d4 + 4} berserker||berserkers. To use the bronze horn, you must be proficient with medium armor.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserker||berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.
