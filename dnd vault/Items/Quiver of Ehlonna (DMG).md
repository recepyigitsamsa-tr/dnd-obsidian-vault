## Description

Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrow|phb|arrows, crossbow bolt|phb|bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelin|phb|javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaff|phb|quarterstaffs, or spear|phb|spears.

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.
