## Description

The top of this black, adamantine staff is shaped like a spider. The staff weighs 6 pounds. You must be attuned to the staff to gain its benefits and cast its spells. The staff can be wielded as a quarterstaff. It deals 1d6 damage extra poison damage on a hit when used to make a weapon attack.

The staff has 10 charges, which are used to fuel the spells within it. With the staff in hand, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from the staff if the spell is on your class's spell list: spider climb spell (1 charge) or web spell (2 charges, spell save DC 15 Saving Throw). No components are required.

The staff regains {@dice 1d6 + 4} expended charges each day at dusk. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.
