## Description

These metallic nodules were created in response to the poisonous gases used on the battlefields of the Last War. When you attune to these lungs, they replace the lungs in your chest, which disappear. The lungs allow you to breathe normally, even in an antimagic field, and their breathing function can't be suppressed by magic.

Outside an antimagic field or any other effect that suppresses magic, these lungs allow you to breathe normally in any environment (including a vacuum), and you have advantage on saving throws against harmful gases such as those created by a cloudkill spell spell, a stinking cloud spell spell, inhaled poisons, and gaseous breath weapons.

As an action, you can use these lungs to exhale a gust of wind, as if you had cast the gust of wind spell spell (spell save DC 15 Saving Throw) with no components. This property of the lungs can't be used again until the next dawn.

If your attunement to the lungs ends, your original lungs reappear.
