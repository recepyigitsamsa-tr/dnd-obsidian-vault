## Description

These leather-framed goggles feature purple crystal lenses. While wearing the goggles, you have advantage on Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) checks made to reveal information about a creature or object you can see.

In addition, you can cast the identify spell spell using the googles. Once you do so, you can't do so again until the next dawn.
