## Description

Distilled from the ichor of demons, zeal|TDCSR was originally used by Tal'Dorei's ancient berserkers to grant them incredible strength and courage before battles. These days, it's most commonly used by criminal bruisers before a brawl. Most modern warriors stay well away from zeal|TDCSR, due both to its addictive nature and to the mental and physical degeneration it can cause over long periods of time. When prepared properly, zeal|TDCSR is a purple, ashy-tasting gel that typically costs 150 gp per dose.

After slathering zeal|TDCSR across your exposed skin as an action, you must make a DC 12 Saving Throw Constitution {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw}. On a failure, you become paralyzed condition for {@dice 1d4} rounds as your muscles lock up. On a success, your weapon attacks deal an additional 1d6 damage damage for the next minute. After this effect ends, you gain one level of exhaustion condition.
