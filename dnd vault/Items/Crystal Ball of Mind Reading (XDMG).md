## Description

While touching this crystal orb, you can cast Scrying|XPHB spell (save DC 17 Saving Throw) with it. In addition, you can cast Detect Thoughts|XPHB spell (save DC 17 Saving Throw) targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this Detect Thoughts|XPHB spell spell to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if the Scrying|XPHB spell spell ends.
