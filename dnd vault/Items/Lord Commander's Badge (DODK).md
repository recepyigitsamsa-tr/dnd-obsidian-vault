## Description

As an action while wearing this seal, you can invoke its power to issue a bellowing command clearly audible to all creatures within 300 feet of you. When you do, you may choose up to 12 allies you can see who can hear the command. Those allies each gain 20 temporary hit points. While these temporary hit points remain, those allies gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws. Once you use this power, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Crown Authority

A character cannot attune to more than one Seal of Drakkenheim. Guardian constructs in Drakkenheim such as wall gargoyle|DoDk|wall gargoyles and tower dragon|DoDk|tower dragons do not attack you while you are attuned to one of the Seals of Drakkenheim. An individual guardian ignores this effect for 24 hours if you attack it or cast a spell upon it.

As an action, you may present a Seal of Drakkenheim to rebuke the guardians. You make an opposed Charisma ability check against each wall gargoyle|DoDk or tower dragon|DoDk that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you. If you win the contest, the creature is rebuked for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A rebuked creature doesn't move, and can't take actions or reactions. A creature who wins the contest is immune to your rebuke for 24 hours.
