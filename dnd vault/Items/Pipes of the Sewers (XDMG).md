## Description

While these pipes are on your person, ordinary rat|XMM|rats and giant rat|XMM|giant rats are {@variantrule Indifferent [Attitude]|XPHB|Indifferent} toward you and won't attack you unless you threaten or harm them.

The pipes have 3 charges and regain {@dice 1d3} expended charges daily at dawn. If you play the pipes as a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you can take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one Swarm of Rats|XMM with each expended charge if enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the DM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise.

Whenever a Swarm of Rats that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, the swarm makes a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes {@variantrule Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB|Friendly} to you and your allies for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as a {@action Magic|XPHB} action. A {@variantrule Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB|Friendly} swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a {@variantrule Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB|Friendly} swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a {@variantrule Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB|Friendly} swarm starts its turn more than 30 feet away from you, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.
