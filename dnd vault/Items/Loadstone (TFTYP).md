## Description

This stone is a large gem worth 150 gp.

### Curse

The stone is cursed, but its magical nature is hidden; detect magic spell doesn't detect it. An identify spell spell reveals the stone's true nature. If you use the {@action Dash} or {@action Disengage} action while the stone is on your person, its curse activates. Until the curse is broken with remove curse spell or similar magic, your speed is reduced by 5 feet, and your maximum load and maximum lift capacities are halved. You also become unwilling to part with the stone.
