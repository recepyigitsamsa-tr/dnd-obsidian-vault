## Description

This object looks like a feather.

You can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 damage Force damage.

As a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to dismiss it, or when you die or have the Incapacitated|XPHB condition condition.
