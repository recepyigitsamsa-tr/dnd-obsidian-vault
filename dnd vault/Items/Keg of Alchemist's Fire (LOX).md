## Description

A keg of alchemist's fire lobbed at a creature or an object deals 21 (6d6 damage) fire damage on a hit. Further, the target is set ablaze and takes the damage again every round (in the case of a creature, at the start of each of its turns) until the fire is put out. A creature within reach of the blaze can take an action to smother the flames using a blanket or carpet, reducing the fire damage by {@dice 2d6}. Three such actions are needed to fully put out the fire.
