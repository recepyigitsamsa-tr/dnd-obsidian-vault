## Description

These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a horseshoe also takes a {@action Magic|XPHB} action.

While all four horseshoes are attached to the same creature, its {@variantrule Speed|XPHB} is increased by 30 feet.
