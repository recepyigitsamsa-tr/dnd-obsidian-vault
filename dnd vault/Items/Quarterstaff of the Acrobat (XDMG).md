## Description

You have a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

While holding this weapon, you can cause it to emit green {@variantrule Dim Light|XPHB} out to 10 feet, either as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} or after you roll {@variantrule Initiative|XPHB}, or you can extinguish the light as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}.

While holding this weapon, you can take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to alter its form, turning it into a 6-inch rod (for ease of storage) or a 10-foot pole, or reverting it a Quarterstaff; the weapon will elongate only as far as the surrounding space allows.

In certain forms, the weapon has the following additional properties.

### Acrobatic Assist (Quarterstaff and 10-Foot Pole Forms Only)

While holding this weapon, you have {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics|XPHB}) checks.

### Attack Deflection (Quarterstaff Form Only)

When you are hit by an attack while holding the weapon, you can take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to twirl the weapon around you, gaining a +5 bonus to your {@variantrule Armor Class|XPHB} against the triggering attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. You can't use this property again until you finish a {@variantrule Short Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}.

### Ranged Weapon (Quarterstaff Form Only)

This weapon has {@itemProperty T|XPHB|Thrown} with a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with the weapon, it flies back to your hand.
