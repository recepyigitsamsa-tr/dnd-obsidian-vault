## Description

This magic weapon has 3 charges and regains {@dice 1d3} expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the weapon, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror from it. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened|XPHB condition condition for 1 minute. While Frightened|XPHB condition in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't make Opportunity Attacks. For its action, it can use only the {@action Dash|XPHB} action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can take the {@action Dodge|XPHB} action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
