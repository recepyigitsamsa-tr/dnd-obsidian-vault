## Description

While touching this crystal orb, you can cast Scrying|XPHB spell (save DC 17 Saving Throw) with it. In addition, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also cast Suggestion|XPHB spell (save DC 17 Saving Throw) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this Suggestion|XPHB spell to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if Scrying|XPHB spell ends. You can't cast Suggestion|XPHB spell in this way again until the next dawn.
