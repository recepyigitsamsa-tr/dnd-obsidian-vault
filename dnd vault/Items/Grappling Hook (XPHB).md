## Description

As a {@action Utilize|XPHB} action, you can throw the Grappling Hook at a railing, a ledge, or another catch within 50 feet of yourself, and the hook catches on if you succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics|XPHB}) check. If you tied a Rope to the hook, you can then climb it.
