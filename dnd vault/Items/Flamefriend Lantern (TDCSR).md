## Description

This wrought-iron lantern holds a small fire elemental spirit. To attune to this item, you must also succeed on a DC 10 Saving Throw Charisma check to bond with the spirit inside the lantern.

### Light and Flame

While attuned to the lantern, you can verbally ask the elemental to glow (no action required), causing the lantern to cast bright light in a radius of your choice up to 60 feet and dim light for the same distance beyond that. You can also cast the produce flame spell cantrip from the lantern at will. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

### Elemental Essence

The fire elemental spirit in the lantern can grant you a small fragment of its power. As an action, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice for 1 hour:

Once the elemental has shared its power with you in this way, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

### Willful Attunement

Your {@quickref attunement|DMG|1|0} to the lantern lasts until you choose to end it, or until you anger the elemental (by dousing the lantern in water, attacking another nonhostile elemental being, and so forth). You can attempt to attune to the lantern again and repeat the check to bond with the elemental during a {@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short or long rest}, but you make this check with {@quickref Advantage and Disadvantage|PHB|2|0|disadvantage} until you have made amends to the spirit, as the GM determines.
