## Description

As a {@action Utilize|XPHB} action, you can use Manacles to bind an unwilling Small or Medium creature within 5 feet of yourself that has the Grappled|XPHB condition, Incapacitated|XPHB condition, or Restrained|XPHB condition condition if you succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand|XPHB}) check. While bound, a creature has {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on attack rolls, and the creature is Restrained|XPHB condition if the Manacles are attached to a chain or hook that is fixed in place. Escaping the Manacles requires a successful DC 20 Saving Throw Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand|XPHB}) check as an action. Bursting them requires a successful DC 25 Saving Throw Strength ({@skill Athletics|XPHB}) check as an action.

Each set of Manacles comes with a key. Without the key, a creature can use Thieves' Tools|XPHB to pick the Manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand|XPHB}) check.
