## Description

This wooden broom functions like a mundane broom until you stand astride it and take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to make it hover beneath you, at which time it can be ridden in the air. It has a {@variantrule Fly Speed|XPHB} of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its {@variantrule Fly Speed|XPHB} becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land or when you're no longer riding it.

As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you name the location and are familiar with it. The broom comes back to you when you take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action and use a command word if the broom is still within 1 mile of you.
