## Description

This cloak is made of heavy dark cloth trimmed with golden patterns, and occasionally shimmers with sparks of arcane energy. It was once worn by the famed gunslinger Percival de Rolo|TDCSR|Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III of Whitestone.

### Dormant

While Cabal's Ruin is in a dormant state, the cloak has 4 charges and it regains {@dice 1d4} expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit with an attack, you can expend any number of charges from the cloak, with the attack dealing an extra 1d6 damage lightning damage per charge expended. If your attack strikes multiple targets, you choose one target that takes this extra damage.

When you are targeted by an enemy's spell, you can use your reaction to absorb a portion of the spell's energy into the cloak. The spell affects you normally, but the cloak regains a number of charges equal to the level of the spell. This property can't be used again until you finish a {@quickref resting|PHB|2|0|short or long rest}.
