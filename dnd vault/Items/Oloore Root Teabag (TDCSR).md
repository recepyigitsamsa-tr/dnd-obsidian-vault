## Description

This root is typically Oloore Root Teabag|TDCSR|sold in teabags for 100 gp per dose. It was originally a ritualistic tool used by the followers of many gods, but now sees more recreational use. Oracles used it to enhance their divinations, for it helped them leave their physical bodies behind and become closer to gods and spirits. Drinking tea brewed from the root causes intense hallucinations, which feel like they have granted perfect clarity of mind to the imbiber.
