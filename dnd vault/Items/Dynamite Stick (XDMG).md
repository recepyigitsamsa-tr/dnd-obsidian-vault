## Description

An an action, you can light a Dynamite Stick and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius {@variantrule Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Sphere} centered on that point makes a DC 12 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 damage Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

It takes 1 minute to bind two or more Dynamite Sticks together so they explode at the same time. Each stick after the first increases the damage by {@dice 1d6} (to a maximum of {@dice 10d6}) and the effect's radius by 5 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet).

It takes 1 minute to rig dynamite with a longer fuse so it explodes after a longer period of time, such as 1 minute or 10 minutes.
