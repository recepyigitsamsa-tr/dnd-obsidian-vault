## Description

Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to 60 Arrow|XPHB|Arrows, Bolt|XPHB|Bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to 18 Javelin|XPHB|Javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to 6 long objects, such as bows, Quarterstaff|XPHB|Quarterstaff's, or Spear|XPHB|Spears.

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.
