The fire giant Duke Zalto hired a wizard to craft several of these adamantine rods. Each measures 4 feet long, weighs 100 pounds, and is sized to fit comfortably in a fire giant||fire giant's hand. The rod has two prongs at one end and a molded handle grip on the opposite end.

The rod has 10 charges and regains {@dice 1d6 + 4} of its expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can grasp it by the handle and expend 1 charge to cast the locate object spell spell from it. When the rod is used to detect objects made of adamantine, such as fragments of the Vonindod construct, its range increases to 10 miles.
