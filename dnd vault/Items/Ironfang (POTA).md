## Description

A war pick|phb forged from a single piece of iron, Ironfang has a fang-like head inscribed with ancient runes. The pick is heavy in the hand, but when the wielder swings the pick in anger, the weapon seems almost weightless. This weapon is immune to any form of rust, acid, or corrosion—nothing seems to mark it. Ironfang contains a spark of Ogrémoch|pota, the Prince of Evil Earth.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra 1d8 damage thunder damage.

### Earth Mastery

You gain the following benefits while you hold Ironfang:

### Shatter

Ironfang has 3 charges. You can use your action to expend 1 charge and cast the 2nd-level version of shatter spell (DC 17 Saving Throw). Ironfang regains {@dice 1d3} expended charges daily at dawn.

### The Rumbling

While inside an earth node, you can perform a ritual called the Rumbling, using Ironfang to create a devastation orb of earth|PotA. Once you perform the ritual, Ironfang can't be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

### Flaw

Ironfang heightens its wielder's destructive nature. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I like to break things and cause ruin."
