## Description

Beautiful silver scrollwork and priceless cut rubies adorn this set of brass-and-gold armor. Legend holds that it was worn by Duana, High Priest of the {@deity The Dawnfather|Exandria|TDCSR}, when she was martyred in the Battle of Ghor Dranas in the final days of the _Calamity_. In more recent times, it was worn by Pike Trickfoot|TDCSR, a legendary cleric of the {@deity The Everlight|Exandria|TDCSR}, while fighting against _the Chroma Conclave_ and {@deity The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR}.
