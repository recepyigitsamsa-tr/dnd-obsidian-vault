**Multiattack.** The bandit lord makes two Longsword attacks and one Dagger attack.

**Longsword.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d8 + 3 damage) slashing damage, or 14 (2d10 + 3 damage) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Dagger.** {@atk mw,rw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}5 (1d4 + 3 damage) piercing damage, or 8 (2d4 + 3 damage) piercing damage if used to make a melee attack.

**Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the bandit lord can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a {@dice d4} to its roll provided it can hear and understand the bandit lord. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the bandit lord is incapacitated condition.

## Reactions

**Parry.** The bandit lord adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the bandit lord must see the attacker and be wielding a weapon.

**Protect Me!.** When a creature the bandit lord can see targets it with an attack, the bandit lord can sidestep behind an ally within 5 feet of it, moving to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the ally. The chosen ally becomes the target of the attack instead.
