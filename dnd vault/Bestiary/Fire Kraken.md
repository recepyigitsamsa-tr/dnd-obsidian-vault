**Multiattack.** The kraken makes two attacks using its Tentacle, Fling, or a combination of the two.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +15 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}18 (3d6 + 8 damage) piercing damage and 7 (2d6 damage) fire damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled condition by the kraken, the creature is swallowed and the grapple ends. While swallowed, a creature has the blinded condition and restrained condition conditions, has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and takes 42 (12d6 damage) fire damage at the start of the kraken's turns. If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, it must succeed on a DC 23 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall into a space within 10 feet of the kraken and now have the prone condition condition. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained condition by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting with the prone condition condition.

**Tentacle.** {@atk mw} +15 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}13 (2d4 + 8 damage) fire damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it has the grappled condition condition (escape DC 16 Saving Throw). While grappled condition, the target also has the restrained condition condition. Any target that starts its turn grappled condition by the kraken takes 5 (2d4 damage) fire damage. The kraken has five tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Fling.** One Large or smaller object or creature grappled condition by the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction, and now has the prone condition condition. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6 damage) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked down with the prone condition condition.

## Legendary Actions

**Appendage.** The kraken makes a Fling attack.

**Fire Breath (Costs 3 Actions).** The kraken exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8 damage) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
