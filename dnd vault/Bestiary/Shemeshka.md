**Multiattack.** Shemeshka uses Arcane Flux or Spellcasting. She then makes one Claw attack or one attack with her Razorvine Tiara.

**Arcane Flux.** Shemeshka causes a surge of arcane energy to burst around one creature she can see within 120 feet of herself. The target must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 45 (7d12 damage) force damage and has the incapacitated condition condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 (2d4 + 5 damage) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6 damage) poison damage.

**Razorvine Tiara.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}10 (3d6 damage) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8 damage) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, or its speed is halved and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of its next turn.

## Reactions

**Fell Counterspell (3/Day).** Shemeshka utters a magical word to interrupt a creature she can see that is casting a spell. If the spell is 5th level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If the spell is 6th level or higher, Shemeshka makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 Saving Throw + the spell's level). On a success, the spell fails and has no effect. Whatever the spell's level, the caster gains the poisoned condition condition until the end of its next turn.
