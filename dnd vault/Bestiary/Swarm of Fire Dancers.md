## Traits

**Elemental Nature.** The swarm of fire dancers doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Fire Form.** A creature that touches the swarm or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10 damage) fire damage. In addition, the first time the swarm enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10 damage) fire damage and catches fire. Until a creature, which can include the target, uses an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 5 (1d10 damage) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Illumination.** The swarm sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light to an additional 30 feet.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny Elemental. The swarm can't regain hp or gain temporary hp.

**Water Susceptibility.** For every 5 feet the swarm moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage.
