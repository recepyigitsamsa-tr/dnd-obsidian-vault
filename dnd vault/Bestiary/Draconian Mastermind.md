## Traits

**Death Throes.** When the draconian is reduced to 0 hit points, its magical essence lashes out as a ball of lightning at the closest creature within 30 feet of it before arcing out to up to two other creatures within 15 feet of the first. Each creature must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 9 (2d8 damage) lightning damage and is stunned condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't stunned condition.

**Multiattack.** The draconian makes three Rend or Energy Ray attacks.

**Rend.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 (1d6 + 2 damage) slashing damage.

**Energy Ray.** {@atk rs} +6 to hit to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d10 + 3 damage) force damage.

**Noxious Breath {@recharge 5}.** The draconian exhales a 15-foot cone of noxious gas. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 21 (6d6 damage) poison damage and gains 1 level of exhaustion condition. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, doesn't gain exhaustion condition, and is immune to all draconians' Noxious Breath for 24 hours.

## Reactions

**Magic Shield (3/Day).** When the draconian is hit by an attack roll, it can create an invisible condition barrier of magical force around itself, granting it a +5 bonus to its AC against that attack and potentially causing the attack to miss.
