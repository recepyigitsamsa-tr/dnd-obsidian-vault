**Stench Spray {@recharge 5}.** The tusked skyfish sprays foulâ€‘smelling liquid in a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6 damage) poison damage and is poisoned condition for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned condition. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature falls unconscious condition while poisoned condition in this way. The unconscious condition creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. A poisoned condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
