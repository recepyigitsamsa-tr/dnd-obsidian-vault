**Overwhelming Revelation {@recharge 5}.** The diviner magically creates a burst of illumination in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 45 (10d8 damage) psychic damage and is stunned condition until the end of the diviner's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't stunned condition.

## Reactions

**Portent (3/Day).** When the diviner or a creature it can see makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, the diviner rolls a {@dice d20} and chooses whether to use that roll in place of the {@dice d20} rolled for the attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.
