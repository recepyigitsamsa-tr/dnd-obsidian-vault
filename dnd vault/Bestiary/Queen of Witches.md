**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the Queen of Witches fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Token of Favor.** The Queen of Witches can spend 1 minute cutting and tying a lock of her hair into a small token of her favor. A creature that is wearing or carrying the favor gains the benefits of the Magic Resistance trait. The Queen can revoke this magic at any time (no action required). If she does so, the creature has disadvantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects for 24 hours.

## Reactions

**Absorb Spell.** When a creature the Queen of Witches can see within 30 feet of her casts a spell, the Queen can absorb the spell's energy, countering it. This works like the counterspell spell spell, except the Queen must always make a spellcasting ability check, no matter the spell's level. Her ability check for this is +10. If she successfully counters the spell, she regains 5 hp for each level of the spell.
