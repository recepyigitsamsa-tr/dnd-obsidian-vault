**Whirlwind {@recharge 4}.** Each creature in the elemental's space must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 15 (3d8 + 2 damage) bludgeoning damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the elemental in a random direction and knocked prone condition. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6 damage) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown.

If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked prone condition.
