If the target is a Medium or smaller creature and the chelicerae doesn't have another creature grappled condition, the target is grappled condition (escape DC 15 Saving Throw). A poisoned condition target is also unconscious condition while poisoned condition in this way. The poisoned condition target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the poisoned condition condition on itself on a success.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}15 (2d8 + 6 damage) slashing damage.

**Magical Discharge (Recharge Special).** The chelicerae releases some of its stored magical energy in a burst.

After using Magical Discharge, the chelicerae can't do so again until it successfully siphons magic from a creature or until it finishes a long rest.
