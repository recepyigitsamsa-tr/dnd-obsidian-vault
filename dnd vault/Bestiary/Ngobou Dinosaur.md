## Traits

**Elephants' Bane.** The ngobou has advantage on attack rolls against elephants. It can pinpoint, by scent, the location of any elephant or elephant material no older than 48 hours within 120 feet of it.

**Jagged Hide.** At the start of each of its turns, the ngobou deals 4 (1d8 damage) piercing damage to any creature grappling it.

**Reckless.** At the start of its turn, the ngobou can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls it makes during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn. If the ngobou detects an elephant within 120 feet of it, this trait is always active, and the ngobou can't choose to end it until it starts its turn more than 120 feet from an elephant.

**Trampling Charge.** If the ngobou moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Gore attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be knocked prone condition. If the target is prone condition, the ngobou can make one Stomp attack against it as a bonus action.
