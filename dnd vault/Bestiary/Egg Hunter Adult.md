## Traits

**Amphibious.** The egg hunter can breathe air and water.

**False Appearance.** If the egg hunter is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the egg hunter move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to discern that the egg hunter is animate. Dragons have disadvantage on this check.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Barbed Proboscis | +8 to hit | 1d6 + 5 damage) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8 damage) necrotic | - |
| Torpor Spores {@recharge 5} | DC 14 | - | - |

**Multiattack.** The egg hunter makes two Barbed Proboscis attacks, and it can use Torpor Spores if it's available.

**Barbed Proboscis.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d6 + 5 damage) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8 damage) necrotic damage, and the egg hunter regains hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.

**Torpor Spores {@recharge 5}.** The egg hunter releases a billow of sparkling blue spores. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the egg hunter must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be poisoned condition for 1 minute. While poisoned condition in this way, the creature can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn but not both, and it can't take reactions. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this egg hunter's Torpor Spores for the next 24 hours.

## Reactions

**Rapid Adaptation.** When the egg hunter takes damage, it gives itself resistance to that damage.
