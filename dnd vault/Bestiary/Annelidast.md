## Traits

**Deep Earth Dweller.** The annelidast doesn't require air.

**Primordial Aura.** A creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the annelidast must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6 damage) poison damage.

**Tunneler.** The annelidast can burrow through solid rock at half its burrow speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Slam | +12 to hit | 2d12 + 8 damage) bludgeoning | - |

**Multiattack.** The annelidast makes three Slam attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}21 (2d12 + 8 damage) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from the annelidast. A creature restrained condition by the annelidast automatically succeeds on this saving throw.

**Crush {@recharge 5}.** The annelidast launches most of its massive bulk into the air and crashes down on the ground in a 20-foot line that is 10 feet wide. It then retracts itself into a space along that line and can occupy the space of one or more Large or smaller creatures. Each creature in the line must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 45 (7d12 damage) bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone condition, and is restrained condition while it shares a space with the annelidast, as it is pinned beneath the annelidast's body. On a success, a creature takes half the damage, isn't knocked prone condition, and is pushed out of the annelidast's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice within 5 feet of the annelidast. A creature, including the restrained condition creature, can take its action to free the restrained condition creature by succeeding on a DC 17 Saving Throw Strength check. If the annelidast burrows along the surface of the earth at least 20 feet before using this action, creatures in the line have disadvantage on the saving throw.

## Reactions

**Defensive Recoil.** When the annelidast takes damage, it can make one Slam attack against a creature restrained condition by it.
