**Multiattack.** The gigant makes one Mandibles attack and two Talons attacks.

**Mandibles.** {@atk mw} +13 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. {@h}21 (4d6 + 7 damage) slashing damage, and the target has the grappled condition condition (escape DC 17 Saving Throw). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 21 (4d6 + 7 damage) slashing damage at the start of each of the gigant's turns. While the gigant is grappling a target, it can't use Mandibles against other targets.

**Talons.** {@atk mw} +13 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}17 (3d6 + 7 damage) slashing damage, and the target is pulled 10 feet straight toward the gigant.

**Scale Dust {@recharge 5}.** The gigant releases magical dust from its wings in a 30-foot cube. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (10d8 damage) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a success or failure, the creature has the poisoned condition condition for 1 hour. While poisoned condition this way, the creature can't regain hit points.
