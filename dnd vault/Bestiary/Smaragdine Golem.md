**Enchanted Weapons.** The golem's weapon attacks are magical. When the golem hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 5d8 damage force damage (included in the attack).

**Immutable Form.** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Magic Resistance.** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Slam | +12 to hit | 3d8 + 7 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 22 (5d8 damage) force | - |
| Release Spell (Recharge Special) | DC 18 | 3d6 damage) force | - |

**Multiattack.** The smaragdine golem makes two Slam attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Release Spell.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}20 (3d8 + 7 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 22 (5d8 damage) force damage.

**Release Spell (Recharge Special).** The smaragdine golem releases an absorbed spell's energy in a green burst centered on a point the golem can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature, other than the smaragdine golem, within 5 feet of that point per level of the absorbed spell must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6 damage) force damage per level of the absorbed spell and is incapacitated condition until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't incapacitated condition. The golem can use this action only if it is Charged (see the Magic Vessel trait).

## Reactions

**Absorb Spell.** When a creature the smaragdine golem can see within 30 feet of it casts a spell, the golem can absorb the spell's energy, countering it. This works like the counterspell spell spell, except the golem must always make a spellcasting ability check, no matter the spell's level. Alternatively, when a creature the golem can see within 30 feet of the golem starts its turn while under the effects of a spell, such as bless or heroes' feast, the golem can absorb the spell's magic, ending the effect. In either case, the golem's ability check for this is +10. If it successfully counters or ends the spell, it becomes Charged (see the Magic Vessel trait). The golem can't use Absorb Spell while it is Charged.
