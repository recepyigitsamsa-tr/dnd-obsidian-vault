## Traits

**Ghostly Body (Void Ghost Form Only).** The nihilethic dominator has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. In addition, the dominator can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10 damage) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the nihilethic dominator to 0 hp, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the dominator drops to 1 hp instead.
