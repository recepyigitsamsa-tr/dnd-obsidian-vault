**Bite.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 (1d10 + 2 damage) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4 damage) necrotic damage.

**Desiccating Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales yellowish necrotic energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 11 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 21 (6d6 damage) necrotic damage and is weakened until the end of its next turn. A weakened creature has disadvantage on Strength-based ability checks and Strength saving throws, and the creature's weapon attacks that rely on Strength deal half damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't weakened.
