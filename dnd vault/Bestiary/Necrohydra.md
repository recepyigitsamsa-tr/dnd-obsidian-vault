## Traits

**Multiple Heads.** The necrohydra has five fleshy heads. While it has more than one head, the necrohydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded condition, charmed condition, deafened condition, frightened condition, stunned condition, and knocked unconscious condition. Whenever the necrohydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its fleshy heads dies. If all its fleshy heads die, the necrohydra can't use or maintain Dreadful Dirge. At the end of its turn, it grows two skeletal heads for each of its fleshy heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken radiant damage since its last turn. The necrohydra regains 10 hp for each skeletal head regrown in this way.

**Reactive Heads.** For each head the necrohydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.

**Undead Nature.** The necrohydra doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

The necrohydra must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue wailing. It can stop wailing at any time. The wail ends if the necrohydra is incapacitated condition. A frightened condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
