**Awakening of the Scion.** The cradle is a container for the scion of Surtur|BGG. When the cradle drops to 0 hit points, its body hardens and crumbles to ash. The scion instantly appears in the space the cradle occupied and uses the cradle's initiative count.

**Magic Resistance.** The cradle has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster.** The cradle deals double damage to objects and structures.

**Multiattack.** The cradle makes three Slam or Hurl Lava attacks in any combination.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +17 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}31 (4d10 + 9 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6 damage) fire damage.

**Hurl Lava.** {@atk rw} +17 to hit to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}27 (4d8 + 9 damage) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature within 5 feet of the fire takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 10 (3d6 damage) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Erupting Breath {@recharge 5}.** The cradle exhales flames and volcanic gases in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 55 (10d10 damage) fire damage and has the poisoned condition condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

A creature poisoned condition in this way can make a DC 24 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
