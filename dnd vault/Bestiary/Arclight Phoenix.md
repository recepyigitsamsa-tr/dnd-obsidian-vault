## Traits

**Flyby.** The arclight phoenix doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Grounded Lightning.** The first time on a turn that the arclight phoenix touches the ground, it takes 11 (2d10 damage) force damage.

**Illumination.** The arclight phoenix sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.

**Lightning Form.** The arclight phoenix can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the phoenix or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 9 (2d8 damage) lightning damage. In addition, the arclight phoenix can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 9 (2d8 damage) lightning damage.

**Crackling Death.** When the arclight phoenix dies, it explodes. Each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8 damage) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion destroys the phoenix but leaves behind a Tiny, warm egg with a mizzium shell. The egg contains the embryo of a new arclight phoenix. It hatches when it is in the area of a spell that deals lightning damage, or if a creature touches the egg and expends spell slots whose combined levels equal 13 or more. When it hatches, the egg releases a new arclight phoenix that appears in the egg's space.
