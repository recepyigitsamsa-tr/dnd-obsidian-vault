**Multiattack.** The devil makes two attacks: one with its beard and one with its glaive.

**Beard.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}6 (1d8 + 2 damage) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be poisoned condition for 1 minute. While poisoned condition in this way, the target can't regain hit points. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Glaive.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d10 + 3 damage) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or lose 5 ({@dice 1d10}) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 5 (1d10 damage). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 Saving Throw Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.
