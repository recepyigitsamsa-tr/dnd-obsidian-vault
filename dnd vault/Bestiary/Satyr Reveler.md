**Enthralling Performance.** If the satyr performs for at least 1 minute, it chooses up to four humanoids within 60 feet of it who watched or listened to the entire performance. Each target must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be charmed condition. While charmed condition in this way, the target idolizes the satyr and will take part in the satyr's revels. The charmed condition condition ends for the creature after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if the satyr attacks the target, or if the target witnesses the satyr attacking or damaging any of the target's allies.

**Magic Resistance.** The satyr has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
