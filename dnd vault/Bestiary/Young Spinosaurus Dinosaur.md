**Hold Breath.** The spinosaurus can hold its breath for 1 hour.

**Reptilian Affinity.** The spinosaurus never willingly attacks a reptilian Humanoid, such as a lizardfolk or dragonborn, unless attacked first. If magically forced to attack such a creature, the spinosaurus has disadvantage on attack rolls against it. This trait doesn't function if the spinosaurus's rider or tamer directs it to attack.
