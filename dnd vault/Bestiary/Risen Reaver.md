## Reactions

**Infused Arsenal.** When the risen reaver is hit with a nonmagical melee weapon or when it starts its turn in the same space as a nonmagical melee weapon that isn't being worn or carried, it absorbs the weapon into its body. If the weapon is being wielded by an attacker, the attacker must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or lose its weapon. For 1 minute, the reaver has resistance to the type of damage dealt by that weapon, and when it hits with its Bladed Fist, the fist deals an extra 2 1d4 damage damage of the type dealt by the weapon. The reaver can absorb no more than three weapons in this way every 24 hours.
