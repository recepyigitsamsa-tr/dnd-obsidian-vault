**Overriding Theorem {@recharge 4}.** The professor magically influences the mind of up to two creatures it can see within 60 feet of itself. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Intelligence saving throw or become charmed condition by the professor until the start of the professor's next turn. The charmed condition creature must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move up its speed toward another creature of the professor's choice and make one melee attack against that other creature.

## Reactions

**Divide by Zero (2/Day).** When the professor sees another creature within 60 feet of itself casting a spell, the professor can try to nullify the spell's formation. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw saving throw using the spell's spellcasting ability, or the spell fails and is wasted.
