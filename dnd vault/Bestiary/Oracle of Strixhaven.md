**Paradoxy {@recharge 4}.** Momentary warps in reality appear at three different points the Oracle can see within 120 feet of her. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on each point must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 (6d10 damage) force damage and is pulled up to 15 feet in a straight line toward the center of the sphere. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled. A creature caught in the area of multiple warps is affected by only one, which the Oracle chooses.

**Vortex Jaunt (Costs 2 Actions).** The Oracle uses Teleport, and immediately after she disappears, each creature within 30 feet of the space she left must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 16 (3d10 damage) force damage.
