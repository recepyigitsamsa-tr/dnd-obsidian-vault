## Traits

**Enthralled Lure (1/Day).** The soul shaker can cast the geas spell spell, requiring no spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12 Saving Throw).

**Reconstruction.** When the soul shaker is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes into 7 ({@dice 1d4 + 5}) crawling claws. After 6 ({@dice 1d12}) days, if at least two of those crawling claws are alive, they teleport to the location of the soul shaker's death and merge together, whereupon the soul shaker reforms and regains all its hit points.

**Unusual Nature.** The soul shaker doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
