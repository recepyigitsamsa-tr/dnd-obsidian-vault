## Traits

**Wand of Orcus.** The wand has 7 charges, and any of its properties that require a saving throw have a save DC of 18. While holding it, Orcus can use an action to cast animate dead spell, blight spell, or speak with dead spell. Alternatively, he can expend 1 or more of the wand's charges to cast one of the following spells from it: circle of death spell (1 charge), finger of death spell (1 charge), or power word kill spell (2 charges). The wand regains {@dice 1d4 + 3} charges daily at dawn.

While holding the wand, Orcus can use an action to conjure undead creatures whose combined average hit points don't exceed 500. These undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of Orcus and obey his commands until they are destroyed or until he dismisses them as an action. Once this property of the wand is used, the property can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Orcus fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Orcus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** Orcus's weapon attacks are magical.

**Master of Undeath.** When Orcus casts animate dead spell or create undead spell, he chooses the level at which the spell is cast, and the creatures created by the spells remain under his control indefinitely. Additionally, he can cast create undead spell even when it isn't night.
