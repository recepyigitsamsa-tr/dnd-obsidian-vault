**Multiattack.** The quori makes two Soul Binding attacks. Alternatively, it can make four attacks with Arcane Blast.

**Arcane Blast.** {@atk rs} +13 to hit to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}12 (1d10 + 7 damage) force damage.

**Soul Binding.** {@atk ms} +13 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}29 (4d10 + 7 damage) necrotic damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points from this attack dies and has its soul imprisoned in one of the quori's eyes. The target can't be revived by any means short of a wish spell spell until the quori is destroyed.

**Mind Seed (1/Day).** The quori touches one humanoid, which must succeed on a DC 21 Saving Throw Intelligence saving throw or be cursed. The curse lasts until it's removed by a remove curse or greater restoration spell spell.

The cursed target suffers 1 level of exhaustion condition every 24 hours, and finishing a long rest doesn't reduce its exhaustion condition. If the cursed target reaches exhaustion condition level 6, it doesn't die; it instead becomes a thrall under the quori's control, and all its exhaustion condition is removed. Only the wish spell spell can free the thrall from this control.

**Swarm of Eyes {@recharge}.** The quori creates a swarm of spectral eyes that fills a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 45 (10d8 damage) psychic damage, and it is blinded condition for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded condition. A blinded condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Possession {@recharge}.** One humanoid that the quori can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 21 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the quori; the quori then disappears, and the target is incapacitated condition and loses control of its body. The quori now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The quori can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed condition and frightened condition. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the quori ends it as a bonus action, or the quori is forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell spell. When the possession ends, the quori reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this quori's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.
