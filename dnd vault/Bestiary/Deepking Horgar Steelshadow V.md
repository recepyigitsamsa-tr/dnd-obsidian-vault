While enlarged, Horgar is Large, doubles his damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the attacks), and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. If Horgar lacks the room to become Large, he attains the maximum size possible in the space available.

**Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** Horgar magically turns invisible condition until he attacks, casts a spell, or uses his Enlarge, or until his {@status concentration} is broken, up to 1 hour (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). Any equipment Horgar wears or carries is invisible condition with him.

**Multiattack.** Horgar makes two melee attacks.

**+2 Warhammer.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 (1d8 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage, or 11 (1d10 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands. While Horgar is enlarged, the damage increases to 15 (2d8 + 6 damage) or 17 (2d10 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage, respectively.

**Heavy Crossbow.** {@atk rw} +2 to hit to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. {@h}5 (1d10 damage) piercing damage.

**Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, Horgar can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that he can see within 30 feet of Horgar makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a {@dice d4} to its roll provided it can hear and understand Horgar. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if Horgar is incapacitated condition.

## Reactions

**Parry.** Horgar adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit him. To do so, Horgar must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
