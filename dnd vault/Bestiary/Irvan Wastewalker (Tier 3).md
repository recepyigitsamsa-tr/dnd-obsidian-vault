**Special Equipment.** Irvan wears gloves of swimming and climbing and wields a ruidium shortsword (see appendix B). If Irvan rolls a 1 on an attack roll made with the shortsword, he must succeed on a DC 20 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion condition.

In addition, Irvan has a magical prosthetic arm. While the arm is attached to him, it functions the same as the body part it is replacing. Irvan can attach or detach the arm as an action, and it can't be removed by anyone else.
