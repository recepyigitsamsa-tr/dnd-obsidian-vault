## Traits

**Bound to Candlekeep.** Miirym can't leave Candlekeep and is immune to any effect that would place her in a location outside it, including an extradimensional space. If she dies, Miirym regains her form and all her hit points after {@dice 1d10} days, reappearing in the location where she died or in the nearest unoccupied space.

**Regeneration.** Miirym regains 40 hit points at the start of her turn. If Miirym takes damage from a magic weapon or a spell, this trait doesn't function at the start of Miirym's next turn. Miirym dies only if she starts her turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Incorporeal Movement.** Miirym can move through other creatures and objects as if they were {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. She takes 5 (1d10 damage) force damage if she ends her turn inside an object.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Miirym fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**X-Ray Vision.** Miirym can see through solid matter out to a range of 60 feet. To her, opaque creatures, objects, and obstacles within that distance appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them. This vision can penetrate 5 feet of stone, 3 inches of common metal, and up to 10 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block this vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.
