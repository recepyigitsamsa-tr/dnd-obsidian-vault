**Multiattack.** Gremorly makes three Withering Strike attacks.

**Withering Strike.** {@atk ms} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}19 (3d12 damage) necrotic damage.

**Fell Necromancy.** Gremorly targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of himself. The target must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 61 (7d8 + 30 damage) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, Gremorly regains 9 ({@dice 2d8}) hit points.

**Possession {@recharge}.** One Humanoid Gremorly can see within 5 feet of himself must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw or be possessed by him; Gremorly disappears, and the target has the incapacitated condition condition and loses control of its body. Gremorly can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn Undead, and he retains his alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to the charmed condition and frightened condition conditions. He otherwise uses the target's game statistics, but Gremorly doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the target drops to 0 hit points, Gremorly ends it as a bonus action, or Gremorly is turned or forced out by an effect like the Dispel Evil and Good spell spell. When the possession ends, Gremorly reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target. The target is immune to this Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.
