**Pillar of Truth.** The nonaton chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 60 feet of itself. A 60-foot-tall, 20-foot-radius cylinder of magical force rises from that point.

On a failed save, a creature takes 21 (6d6 damage) force damage, and the creature reverts to its original form (if it's in a different form) and can't assume a different form until the end of its next turn.
