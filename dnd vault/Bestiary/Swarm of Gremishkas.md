## Traits

**Limited Spell Immunity.** The swarm automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells of 3rd level or lower, and the attack rolls of such spells always miss it.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny gremishka. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Bites | +4 to hit | 3d6 + 2 damage) piercing | - |

**Bites.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. {@h}12 (3d6 + 2 damage) piercing damage, or 5 (1d6 + 2 damage) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer, plus 7 (2d6 damage) force damage.

## Reactions

**Spell Redirection.** In response to a spell attack roll missing the swarm, the swarm causes that spell to hit another creature of its choice within 30 feet of it that it can see.
