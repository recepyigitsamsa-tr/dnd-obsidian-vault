## Traits

**Counting Compulsion.** If a creature uses an action to point out an ordered group of objects that the rubezahl can see, such as a pile of gravel, the demon is compelled to count the entire group. Until the end of its next turn, the rubezahl has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and it can't take reactions. Once it has counted a given group of objects, it can't be compelled to count those objects again.

**False Tongue.** The rubezahl has advantage on Charisma ({@skill Deception}) checks. In addition, magical attempts to discern lies always report that the rubezahl's words are true, and it can't be magically forced to tell the truth.

**Magic Resistance.** The rubezahl has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
