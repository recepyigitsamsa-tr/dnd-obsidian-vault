**Garrote.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target of the meazel's size or smaller. {@h}6 (1d6 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 13 Saving Throw with disadvantage). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 10 (2d6 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the meazel's turns. The meazel can't make weapon attacks while grappling a creature in this way.

**Shortsword.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 (1d6 + 3 damage) piercing damage, plus 3 (1d6 damage) necrotic damage.

**Shadow Teleport {@recharge 5}.** The meazel, any equipment it is wearing or carrying, and any creature it is grappling teleport to an unoccupied space within 500 feet of it, provided that the starting space and the destination are in dim light or darkness. The destination must be a place the meazel has seen before, but it need not be within line of sight. If the destination space is occupied, the teleportation leads to the nearest unoccupied space.

Any other creature the meazel teleports becomes cursed by shadow for 1 hour. Until this curse ends, every undead and every creature native to the Shadowfell within 300 feet of the cursed creature can sense it, which prevents that creature from hiding from them.
