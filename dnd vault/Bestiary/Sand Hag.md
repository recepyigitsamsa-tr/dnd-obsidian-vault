## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The sand hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Mimicry.** The sand hag can mimic animal sounds and Humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 16 Saving Throw Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check.

**Scorpion Walk.** Difficult terrain composed of sand or gravel doesn't cost the hag extra movement. In addition, while in sandy terrain, she doesn't leave tracks and has tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.

**Multiattack.** The hag makes three Claw attacks. If two Claw attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion condition. A creature can't suffer more than two levels of exhaustion condition from this effect.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 (2d8 + 4 damage) slashing damage.

**Illusory Appearance.** The sand hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and Humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

**Scouring Sirocco {@recharge 5}.** The sand hag generates a blast of hot wind and sand in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6 damage) slashing damage and 9 (2d8 damage) fire damage and is blinded condition for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't blinded condition. A blinded condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The area is heavily obscured by airborne sand until the start of the sand hag's next turn.
