**Multiattack.** The dryad makes two Poisonous Thorn attacks and one Sapping Vine attack.

**Poisonous Thorn.** {@atk mw,rw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. {@h}13 (4d4 + 3 damage) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6 damage) poison damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition condition until the start of the dryad's next turn.

**Sapping Vine.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. {@h}The target has the grappled condition condition (escape DC 16 Saving Throw). Until the grapple ends, the target has the restrained condition condition, and the dryad can't use the same vine on another target. A creature restrained condition in this way takes 13 (3d8 damage) necrotic damage at the start of its turn.

The dryad has six vines. Each vine can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage). Destroying a vine deals no damage to the dryad, but any creature grappled condition by that vine no longer has the grappled condition condition. All vines immediately wither and disappear when the dryad is reduced to 0 hit points.
