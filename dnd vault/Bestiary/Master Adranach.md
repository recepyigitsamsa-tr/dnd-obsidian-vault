## Traits

**Arcane Leak.** When the adranach is reduced to half its hit point maximum (145 hit points), its mithral mask cracks and its arcane form begins to waver, creating a field of unstable magic around it. Any creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the adranach or enters that area for the first time on a turn takes 21 (6d6 damage) radiant damage. Additionally, if a creature casts a spell within this area, it must make a DC 18 Saving Throw ability check using its spellcasting ability. On a failure, the spell backfires, consuming the spell slot and dealing 7 (2d6 damage) force damage to the caster for each level of the spell slot that was consumed.

**Immutable Form.** The adranach is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Magic Resistance.** The adranach has {@quickref Advantage and Disadvantage|PHB|2|0|advantage} on {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1} against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The adranach's weapon attacks are magical.

**Colossal Build.** The adranach's carrying capacity is doubled, as is the weight it can push, drag, or lift.

**Slipstream.** The adranach can cast invisibility spell on itself at will. While it is invisible condition, its speed is doubled.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the adranach fails a {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw}, it can choose to succeed instead.

## Legendary Actions

**Claw Attack.** The adranach makes one claw attack.

**Vanish (Costs 2 Actions).** The adranach casts invisibility spell and moves up to its walking or flying speed. (This movement doesn't benefit from its Slipstream trait.)

Each creature within 60 feet of it must make a DC 22 Saving Throw Constitution {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw}. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (5d10 damage) force damage and is blinded condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not blinded condition. The adranach then turns invisible condition until the start of its next turn or until it makes an attack.
