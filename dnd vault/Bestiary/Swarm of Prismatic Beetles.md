## Traits

**Glittering Carapace.** When a creature that can see the swarm starts its turn within 30 feet of the swarm and the swarm is in bright or dim light, the swarm can force the creature to make a DC 13 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw if the swarm isn't incapacitated condition and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature falls unconscious condition. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save is incapacitated condition and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn, as it remains transfixed in place by the glitter of the swarm. A creature has advantage on the saving throw if the swarm is in dim light. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the swarm until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the swarm in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hp or gain temporary hp.
