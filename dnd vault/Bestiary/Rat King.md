**Multiattack.** The rat king makes two Bite attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 (2d6 + 3 damage) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) poison damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion condition and become infected with a disease. Until the disease is cured, at the end of each long rest, the creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature suffers another level of exhaustion condition. The exhaustion condition lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws recovers from the disease.

**Call Rats (1/Day).** The rat king magically calls {@dice 2d4} rats, {@dice 1d4} giant rats, or 1 swarm of rats. The rats arrive in {@dice 1d4} rounds, acting as allies of the rat king and obeying its spoken commands. The rats remain for 1 hour, until the rat king dies, or until the rat king dismisses them as a bonus action.

## Reactions

**Absorption.** When a friendly rat, giant rat, or swarm of rats starts its turn within 5 feet of the rat king, the rat king can absorb it. If the rat king does so, the target dies, and the rat king gains temporary hp equal to the target's remaining hp.
