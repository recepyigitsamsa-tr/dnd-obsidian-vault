**Tongue Lash.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}10 (1d12 + 4 damage) bludgeoning damage.

**Siphon Life {@recharge 4}.** The nergaliid magically draws the life from a humanoid it can see within 40 feet of it. The target must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. An incapacitated condition target fails the save automatically. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6 damage) psychic damage, and the nergaliid gains temporary hit points equal to the damage taken. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the nergaliid doesn't gain temporary hit points. If this damage kills the target, its body rises at the end of the nergaliid's current turn as a husk zombie|EGW (see earlier in this chapter).
