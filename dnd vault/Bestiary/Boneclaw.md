If the target is a creature, the boneclaw can pull the target up to 10 feet toward itself, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 14 Saving Throw). The boneclaw has two claws.

It can bring one creature it's grappling, teleporting that creature to an unoccupied space it can see within 5 feet of its destination. The destination spaces of this teleportation must be in dim light or darkness.
