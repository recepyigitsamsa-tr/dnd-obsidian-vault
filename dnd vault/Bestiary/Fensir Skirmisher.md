## Traits

**Regeneration.** The fensir regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it isn't in sunlight. If the fensir takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the fensir's next turn. The fensir dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Sunlight Hypersensitivity.** When the fensir starts its turn in sunlight, it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or have the petrified condition condition until the fensir is no longer in sunlight.
