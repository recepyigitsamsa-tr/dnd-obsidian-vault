**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Kas fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Special Equipment.** Kas wears the Crown of Lies|VEoR (see the Introduction of Vecna: Eve of Ruin).

**Spider Climb.** Kas can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Strength of the Night.** Kas doesn't require a coffin, and he drinks blood to sow terror rather than for sustenance. If destroyed, Kas revives in {@dice 1d100} nights in an unoccupied space in Tovag, his Domain of Dread. He can be permanently destroyed only by having a stake driven through his heart and then being beheaded. The stake must be cut from a tree growing in soil from Oerth, Kas's home world.

**Sunlight Hypersensitivity.** While in sunlight, Kas takes 20 radiant damage at the start of his turn, has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can't use his Change Shape bonus action.

**Multiattack.** Kas makes three Vengeful Sword attacks. He can replace one of these attacks with a Bite attack.

**Vengeful Sword.** {@atk mw} +15 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}20 (2d8 + 11 damage) slashing damage. The sword scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +15 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}11 (1d6 + 8 damage) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Kas regains a number of hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. A Humanoid slain in this way and then buried rises the following night as a vampire spawn under Kas's control.

## Legendary Actions

**Move.** Kas moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Sword (Costs 2 Actions).** Kas makes one Vengeful Sword attack.

**Rise, Fallen Soldier (Costs 3 Actions).** Kas magically summons a specter. The specter appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of Kas, whom it obeys. The specter takes its turn immediately after Kas. It lasts for 1 hour, until Kas dies, or until Kas dismisses it as a bonus action. Kas can't have more than two specters summoned at a time.


## Reactions

**Parrying Riposte.** Kas adds 3 to his AC against one melee attack roll that would hit him. He then makes one Vengeful Sword attack against the attacker if it is within his reach. On a hit, the target takes an additional 9 (2d8 damage) slashing damage.
