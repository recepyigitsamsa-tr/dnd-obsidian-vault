## Traits

**Distracting Babble.** When a spellcaster that is {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell starts its turn within 20 feet of the mamura, the spellcaster must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or lose {@status concentration} on the spell. In addition, if a spellcaster within 20 feet of the mamura casts a spell, it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or the spell fails to cast, using the action, bonus action, or reaction to cast the spell but not expending the spell slot.

**Flyby.** The mamura doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Magic Resistance.** The mamura has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Radial Eyes.** The mamura has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on sight and on saving throws against being blinded condition. In addition, if the mamura isn't blinded condition, creatures attacking it can't benefit from traits and features that rely on a creature's allies distracting or surrounding the mamura, such as the Pack Tactics trait or Sneak Attack class feature.
