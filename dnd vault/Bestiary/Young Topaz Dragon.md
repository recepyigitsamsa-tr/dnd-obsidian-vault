**Claw.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 (1d6 + 3 damage) slashing damage.

**Desiccating Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales yellowish necrotic energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 28 (8d6 damage) necrotic damage and is weakened until the end of its next turn. A weakened creature has disadvantage on Strength-based ability checks and Strength saving throws, and the creature's weapon attacks that rely on Strength deal half damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't weakened.
