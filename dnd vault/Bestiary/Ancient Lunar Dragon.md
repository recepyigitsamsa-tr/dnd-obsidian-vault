## Legendary Actions

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes one Tail attack.

**Treacherous Ice.** Magical ice covers the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of itself. The ice, which is difficult terrain for all creatures except lunar dragons, lasts for 10 minutes or until the dragon uses this legendary action again.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 21 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take 12 (1d8 + 8 damage) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone condition. The dragon can then fly up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
