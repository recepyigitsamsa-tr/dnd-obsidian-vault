## Traits

**Keen Touch.** The angler worm has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on vibrations.

**Snare Walker.** The angler worm ignores movement restrictions caused by its snares or the snares of other angler worms.

**Spider Climb.** The angler worm can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Transparent Trap.** With 10 minutes of work, the angler worm can create a web of nearly transparent snares in a 20-foot cube. The web must be anchored between two solid masses or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling. A web of snares layered over a flat surface has a depth of 5 feet. The web is difficult terrain, and the snares forming it are nearly transparent, requiring a successful DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to notice them.

A creature that starts its turn in the web of snares or enters the web during its turn must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or be restrained condition by the sticky snares. A creature restrained condition by the snares can use its action to free itself by succeeding on a DC 13 Saving Throw Strength check.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Bite | +4 to hit | 2d6 + 2 damage) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6 damage) acid | - |
| Coils | +4 to hit | 3d6 + 2 damage) bludgeoning | - |
| Ethereal Lure {@recharge 4} | DC 13 | - | - |

**Multiattack.** The angler worm makes two Bite attacks or one Bite attack and one Coils attack.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}9 (2d6 + 2 damage) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6 damage) acid damage.

**Coils.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. {@h}12 (3d6 + 2 damage) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 13 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition by the angler worm, it can't breathe, it takes 10 (3d6 damage) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the angler worm's turns, and the angler worm can't use its Coils on another target.

**Ethereal Lure {@recharge 4}.** The angler worm creates an orb of faint, blue light on a point it can see within 20 feet of it. The light glows until the start of the worm's next turn. When a creature that isn't an angler worm starts its turn within 60 feet of the orb and can see the light, it must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be charmed condition until the start of its next turn. While charmed condition, the creature must take the Dash action and move toward the light by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet of the light. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the charmed condition creature enters the worm's snares, it has disadvantage on the saving throw to avoid being restrained condition.
