**Squatting Pin.** One creature grappled condition by the flab giant must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 22 (5d6 + 5 damage) bludgeoning damage and is restrained condition until the grapple ends.

If the flab giant moves, the target is no longer restrained condition or grappled condition.
