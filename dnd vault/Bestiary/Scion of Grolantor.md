**Multiattack.** The scion makes one Great Tree Club attack and two Slam attacks, or it makes three Boulder attacks.

**Great Tree Club.** {@atk mw} +15 to hit to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. {@h}30 (4d10 + 8 damage) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be pushed horizontally up to 100 feet straight away from the scion and have the prone condition condition.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +15 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}26 (4d8 + 8 damage) force damage.

**Boulder.** {@atk rw} +15 to hit to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. {@h}27 (3d12 + 8 damage) bludgeoning damage.

**Inhale {@recharge 5}.** The scion inhales a vortex of air in a 120-foot line that is 15 feet wide. Each creature in that area that is Huge or smaller must succeed on a DC 23 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 120 feet straight toward the scion and be swallowed. A swallowed creature has the restrained condition condition, has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside the scion, and takes 24 (7d6 damage) force damage at the start of each of the scion's turns.

The scion's stomach can hold up to two creatures at a time. If the scion takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the scion must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which falls in a space within 10 feet of the scion and has the prone condition condition. If the scion dies, any swallowed creature no longer has the restrained condition condition and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting with the prone condition condition.

## Reactions

**Feed.** Immediately after taking damage, if it has at least one creature swallowed, the scion deals 10 (3d6 damage) force damage to each swallowed creature and regains 10 hit points.
