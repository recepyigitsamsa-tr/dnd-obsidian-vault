## Reactions

**Psionic Shield (3/Day).** When the braxat would be hit by an attack roll or a magic missile spell spell that originates from a source the braxat can see, the braxat can create an invisible condition barrier of magical force around itself that lasts until the start of its next turn. This barrier gives the braxat a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and prevents magic missile spell spells from damaging it.
