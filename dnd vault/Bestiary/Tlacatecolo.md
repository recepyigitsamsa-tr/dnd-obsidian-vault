**Multiattack.** The tlacatecolo makes two Talon attacks.

**Talon.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d8 + 3 damage) piercing damage plus 14 (3d8 damage) poison damage.

**Change Shape.** The tlacatecolo magically transforms into a Medium owl, while retaining its game statistics (other than its size). This transformation ends if the tlacatecolo is reduced to 0 hit points or if it uses its action to end it.

**Plague Winds (Fiend Form Only; Recharge 5-6).** The tlacatecolo emits a chilling, disease-ridden wind in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 26 (4d12 damage) cold damage and become poisoned condition.

While poisoned condition in this way, the creature can't regain hit points. At the end of every hour, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion condition. If the creature is in direct sunlight when it makes this saving throw, it automatically succeeds on the save.

If the creature is targeted by magic that ends a poison or disease, such as lesser restoration, while the creature isn't in direct sunlight, the effect does not end.
