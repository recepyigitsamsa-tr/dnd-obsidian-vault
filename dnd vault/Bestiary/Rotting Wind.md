## Traits

**Air Form.** The rotting wind can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

**Invisibility.** The rotting wind is invisible condition.

**Poisonous Aura.** The rotting wind radiates an aura of poison and decay that slowly pollutes the area within 30 feet of it. Each hour the rotting wind stays in a place, nonmagical plants in the aura begin to wither, and water in the aura becomes poisoned condition. Nonmagical plants in the aura for 24 hours die. A creature that drinks water poisoned condition by the aura must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or contract the tomb rot disease (see the Tomb Rot trait). Creatures immune to the poisoned condition condition are immune to this disease.

**Tomb Rot.** A creature infested with this disease manifests symptoms {@dice 1d4} days after infection, which include muscle weakness and rotten-smelling breath as its body rots from the inside out. Until the disease is cured, at the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage and suffer one level of exhaustion condition. This exhaustion condition lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws recovers from the disease.

**Undead Nature.** The rotting wind doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
