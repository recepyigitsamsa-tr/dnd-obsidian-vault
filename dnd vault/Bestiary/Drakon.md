## Traits

**Amphibious.** The drakon can breathe air and water.

**Dissolving Gaze.** When a creature that can see the drakon's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the drakon, the drakon can force it to make a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw if the drakon isn't incapacitated condition and can see the creature. On a failed save, the creature takes 3 (1d6 damage) acid damage, its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the acid damage it takes, and it is paralyzed condition until the start of its next turn. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The creature dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the drakon until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the drakon in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
