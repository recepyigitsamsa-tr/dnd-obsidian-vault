**Shortsword.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 (1d6 + 3 damage) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10 damage) thunder damage.

**Disorienting Words.** Edgin magically taunts up to three creatures he can see within 60 feet of himself. Each creature must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (3d6 damage) psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of Edgin's next turn.

## Reactions

**Inspiring Words (3/Day).** When a creature Edgin can see within 60 feet of himself fails an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw, Edgin grants the creature magical encouragement. The creature can roll a {@dice d8} and add the number rolled to the total, potentially turning the failure into a success.
