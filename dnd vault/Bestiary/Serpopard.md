**Claw.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 (2d6 + 3 damage) slashing damage.

**Musk (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The serpopard releases foul-smelling musk in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6 damage) poison damage and is poisoned condition for 1 hour or until it spends 10 minutes washing off the musk. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned condition. While a creature is poisoned condition in this way, any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the poisoned condition creature must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or be poisoned condition until the end of its turn.
