**Multiattack.** The kot bayun can use its Slumbering Song. It then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 (1d8 + 3 damage) piercing damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 (2d4 + 3 damage) slashing damage.

**Invisibility.** The kot bayun magically turns invisible condition until it attacks or uses Slumbering Song, or until its {@status concentration} ends (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). Any equipment the kot bayun wears or carries is invisible condition with it.

**Slumbering Song.** The kot bayun sings a magical song to one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw on fall unconscious condition for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the kot bayun uses a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing, the target has disadvantage on this saving throw. Otherwise, the effect ends for a target if the target takes damage while below half its hp maximum.

If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the kot bayun's Slumbering Song for the next 24 hours. The kot bayun can have up to two creatures unconscious condition from its song at a time.

**Healing Purr (2/Day).** The kot bayun purrs at a creature it can see within 15 feet of it. The target magically regains 10 ({@dice 3d6}) hp and is freed from any disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.
