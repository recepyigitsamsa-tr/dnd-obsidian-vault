**Warlord Strike {@recharge 5}.** The skeleton commander makes one pike attack. The commander can use a bonus action to direct another undead who can see or hear the commander to attack the target the commander attacked this turn. That undead can use a reaction to make the attack, adding the commander's proficiency bonus to the damage roll.

## Reactions

**Brandish Standard.** If an undead the skeleton commander can see within 30 feet of the commander makes an attack roll or saving throw, the commander can brandish the tattered banner on its pike. If the commander does so, the target can add a {@dice d4} to its roll, provided it can see the commander and isn't receiving this benefit from another commander.
