## Traits

**Apostasy Aura.** The idolic deity's presence causes devout followers to doubt their faith. When a creature attempts to use divine or celestial power, such as a cleric casting a spell or a paladin using Divine Smite, it must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the spell, class feature, or other divine or celestial power is expended, but it has no effect.

**Construct Nature.** The idolic deity doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

**False Appearance.** While the idolic deity remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal statue.

**Incorporeal Movement.** The idolic deity can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10 damage) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
