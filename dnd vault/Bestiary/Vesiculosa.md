## Traits

**Oasis Appearance.** While the vesiculosa remains motionless and partially submerged on the surface of sand or soil, it is indistinguishable from a small oasis or pond. The vesiculosa's pitcher produces enough water for plants to grow around it, provided the vesiculosa remains in the area for an extended period of time. A creature that eats a fruit from a plant growing in the vesiculosa's water is affected by the Sweet Water trait as if it drank the water.

**Sweet Fragrance.** When a creature that can smell the vesiculosa's sweet fragrance starts its turn within 30 feet of the vesiculosa, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be charmed condition for 1 minute. While charmed condition, the creature must move on its turn toward the vesiculosa by the safest available route to get within 5 feet of the plant and drink its water. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the vesiculosa's Sweet Fragrance for the next 24 hours.

**Sweet Water.** A creature that drinks water from the vesiculosa's pitcher regains 5 {@dice 2d4} hp, reduces its exhaustion condition level by 1, and must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious condition for 10 minutes. An unconscious condition creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. Drinking the water provides a creature enough nourishment to sustain it for one day.
