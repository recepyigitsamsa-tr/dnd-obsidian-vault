**Bite.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}19 (2d10 + 8 damage) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage or (3d6 damage) radiant damage (the son's choice). If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the son of Fenris. A swallowed creature is blinded condition and restrained condition, it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside the son, and it takes 21 (6d6 damage) acid damage at the start of each of the son's turns. The son can have only one creature swallowed at a time.

If the son takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the son must succeed on a DC 20 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone condition in a space within 10 feet of the son. If the son dies, the swallowed creature is no longer restrained condition by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone condition.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 (1d10 + 8 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage or (3d6 damage) radiant damage (the son's choice).

**Snake Breath {@recharge 5}.** The two snake tongues of the son of Fenris each exhale poison in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide, resulting in two lines. Each creature in a line must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8 damage) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the lines overlap, each creature in the overlapping lines must make one saving throw with disadvantage against only one of the lines rather than one saving throw for each line.
