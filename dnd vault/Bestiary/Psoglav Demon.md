**Multiattack.** The psoglav makes three Bite attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}18 (2d12 + 5 damage) piercing damage.

**Invisibility.** The psoglav magically turns invisible condition until it attacks or uses Shadow-Stealing Ray, or until its {@status concentration} ends (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). Any equipment the psoglav wears or carries is invisible condition with it.

**Shadow-Stealing Ray {@recharge 5}.** The psoglav emits a beam from its single eye at one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target is pushed up to 20 feet away from the psoglav, and its shadow becomes a creature under the psoglav's control for 24 hours or until the shadow is reduced to 0 hp. On a success, the target is pushed up to 10 feet away from the psoglav and its shadow isn't stolen. Each controlled shadow uses the statistics of a shadow, except it can't create shadows from killing Humanoids. The psoglav can have no more than five shadows under its control at a time. The shadow becomes permanently under the psoglav's control if the shadow's original owner dies.

If a shadow's original owner died within the past minute, the psoglav can command (no action required) the shadow to inhabit and control the body, using the owner's statistics, proficiencies, and class features. A shadow inhabiting a body in this way can't cast spells or activate magic items the owner possessed, and it loses its Amorphous, Shadow {@skill Stealth}, and Sunlight Weakness traits while inhabiting the body. The shadow can inhabit or exit the body as a bonus action. The shadow can inhabit the body for up to 24 hours after the creature died, after which time it is ejected and can't inhabit the body again.

If a creature's saving throw is successful or its shadow is returned to it, the creature is immune to the Shadow-Stealing Ray of all psoglav demons for the next 24 hours.
