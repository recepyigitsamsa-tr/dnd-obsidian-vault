**Multiattack.** Titivilus makes one sword attack and uses his Frightful Word once.

**Silver Sword.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d8 + 4 damage) slashing damage plus 16 (3d10 damage) necrotic damage, or 9 (1d10 + 4 damage) slashing damage plus 16 (3d10 damage) necrotic damage if used with two hands. If the target is a creature, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to half the necrotic damage it takes.

**Frightful Word.** Titivilus targets one creature he can see within 10 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or become frightened condition for 1 minute. While frightened condition in this way, the target must take the Dash action and move away from Titivilus by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which case it needn't take the Dash action. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Teleport.** Titivilus magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

**Twisting Words.** Titivilus targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must make a DC 21 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw. On a failure the target is charmed condition for 1 minute. The charmed condition target can repeat the saving throw if Titivilus deals any damage to it. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to Titivilus's Twisting Words for 24 hours.

## Legendary Actions

**Assault (Costs 2 Actions).** Titivilus attacks with his silver sword or uses his Frightful Word.

**Corrupting Guidance.** Titivilus uses Twisting Words. Alternatively, he targets one creature charmed condition by him that is within 60 feet of him; that charmed condition target must make a DC 21 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw. On a failure, Titivilus decides how the target acts during its next turn.

**Teleport.** Titivilus uses his Teleport action.
