## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The kalke has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.

**Sense Magic.** The kalke senses magic within 120 feet of it at will and can sense the general direction of spells being cast within 1 mile of it. This trait otherwise works like the detect magic spell spell but isn't itself magical.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Slam | +4 to hit | 1d4 + 2 damage) bludgeoning | - |
| Use Magic Item {@recharge 5} | DC 11 | 2d4 damage) force | - |

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}4 (1d4 + 2 damage) bludgeoning damage.

**Use Magic Item {@recharge 5}.** The kalke activates a magic item in its possession and can ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the item. The kalke must make a DC 11 Saving Throw Intelligence saving throw. On a success, the item activates normally. On a failure, the item doesn't activate and can't be used again until the next dawn. If the kalke fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it causes a magical backlash. Each creature within 5 feet of the kalke, including the kalke, must make a DC 11 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 5 (2d4 damage) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
