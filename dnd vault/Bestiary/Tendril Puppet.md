**Root Mind.** The vine lord and the tendril puppets it has created are connected via a hive mind. The vine lord and its puppets can telepathically communicate with each other, provided the communicating creatures are within 1 mile of each other. In addition, while in a forest, the tendril puppet can't be surprised.

**Magic Resistance.** The tendril puppet has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
