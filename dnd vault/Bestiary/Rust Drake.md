## Traits

**Rust Drake Lockjaw.** A creature infected with this disease manifests symptoms {@dice 1d4} days after infection, which include painful muscle spasms, particularly in the jaw. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed condition for 1 hour and have its Dexterity score reduced by {@dice 1d4}. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's Dexterity to 0, the creature dies. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws recovers from the disease.
