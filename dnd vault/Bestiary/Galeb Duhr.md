## Traits

**False Appearance.** While the galeb duhr remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal boulder.

**Rolling Charge.** If the galeb duhr rolls at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6 damage) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be knocked prone condition.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Slam | +8 to hit | 2d6 + 5 damage) bludgeoning | - |
| Animate Boulders (1/Day) | - | - | - |

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d6 + 5 damage) bludgeoning damage.

**Animate Boulders (1/Day).** The galeb duhr magically animates up to two boulders it can see within 60 feet of it. A boulder has statistics like those of a galeb duhr, except it has Intelligence 1 and Charisma 1, it can't be charmed condition or frightened condition, and it lacks this action option. A boulder remains animated as long as the galeb duhr maintains {@status concentration}, up to 1 minute (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell).
