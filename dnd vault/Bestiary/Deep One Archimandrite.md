**Call of the Archimandrite (1/Day).** With a ringing shout, the archimandrite magically calls {@dice 1d4} reef sharks or 1 swarm of quippers, provided the archimandrite is at least partially submerged in a body of water that can contain the creatures. The called creatures arrive in {@dice 1d4} rounds, acting as allies of the archimandrite and obeying its spoken commands. The creatures remain for 1 hour, until the archimandrite dies, or until the archimandrite dismisses them as a bonus action. Each deep one within 1 mile of the archimandrite can hear this call, though these deep ones are under no magical compulsion to make their way toward the archimandrite.
