## Traits

**Damage Transfer.** While it is grappling a creature, the memory web takes only half the damage dealt to it, and the creature grappled condition by the web takes the other half.

**False Appearance.** If the memory web is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the memory web move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to discern that the memory web is animate.

**Memory Flood.** When the memory web is reduced to 0 hit points, it discharges any memories it consumed over the past 24 hours in a telepathic deluge. Hazy, dreamlike visions of these discharged memories lodge in the minds of creatures up to 120 feet from the memory web.
