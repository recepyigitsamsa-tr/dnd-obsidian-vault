**Divine Dread.** Each creature within 60 feet of the eidolon that can see it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be frightened condition for 1 minute. While frightened condition in this way, the creature must take the Dash action and move away from the eidolon by the safest available route at the start of each of its turns, unless there is nowhere for it to move, in which case the creature also becomes stunned condition until it can move again. A frightened condition target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to any eidolon's Divine Dread for the next 24 hours.
