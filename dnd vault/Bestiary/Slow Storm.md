## Traits

**Elemental Nature.** The slow storm doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Eye of the Storm.** The slow storm is surrounded by a 15-foot-radius wind storm. The storm imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks based on sight or hearing within the area. The winds extinguish open flames and disperse fog. A flying creature in the storm must land at the end of its turn or fall. Each creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8 damage) lightning damage. The storm's area is difficult terrain for any creature other than the slow storm.

**Multiattack.** The slow storm makes three Slam attacks or four Lightning Bolt attacks. If two Slam attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be wracked with pain for 1 minute. While the target is wracked with pain, minute bits of electricity dance within its body, and the target takes 4 (1d8 damage) lightning damage for every 5 feet it moves. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}21 (3d10 + 5 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8 damage) lightning damage.

**Lightning Bolt.** {@atk rs} +9 to hit to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}22 (4d8 + 4 damage) lightning damage.

**Static Shock {@recharge 5}.** The slow storm releases built-up electricity in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 54 (12d8 damage) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails this saving throw by 5 or more is also stunned condition for 1 minute. A stunned condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
