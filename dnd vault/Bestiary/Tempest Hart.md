## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Lightning Antlers | +9 to hit | 2d10 + 5 damage) lightning | - |
| Thunder Hooves | +9 to hit | 2d8 + 5 damage) thunder | - |

**Multiattack.** The hart makes a Lightning Antlers attack and a Thunder Hooves attack.

**Lightning Antlers.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}16 (2d10 + 5 damage) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or have the stunned condition condition until the start of the hart's next turn.

**Thunder Hooves.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}14 (2d8 + 5 damage) thunder damage.

## Reactions

**Entangling Growth.** Immediately after a creature the hart can see within 120 feet of itself hits it with an attack roll, the hart reduces the damage to itself by half. The attacker must immediately make a DC 16 Saving Throw Strength saving throw as beanstalks coil around it in its space. On a failed save, the creature has the grappled condition condition (escape DC 16 Saving Throw) and has the restrained condition condition as long as it is grappled condition. The beanstalks vanish after 1 minute, if the hart has the incapacitated condition condition, or when the hart dies.

**Lightning Call.** In response to making a saving throw, the hart calls down a bolt of lightning that targets a creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 19 (3d12 damage) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
