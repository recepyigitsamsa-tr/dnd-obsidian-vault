**Plant Camouflage.** The vegepygmy has advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks it makes in any terrain with ample obscuring plant life.

**Regeneration.** The vegepygmy regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn. If it takes cold, fire, or necrotic damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vegepygmy's next turn. The vegepygmy dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Spores (1/Day).** A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vegepygmy. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area that isn't a plant must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be poisoned condition.

A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
