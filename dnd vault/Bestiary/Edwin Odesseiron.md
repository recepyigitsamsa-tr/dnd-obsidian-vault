**Edwin's Choking Cloud {@recharge}.** Edwin creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous fog centered on a point within 120 feet. The cloud spreads around corners but lasts only until the start of Edwin's next turn. When a creature enters the cloud's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 45 (10d8 damage) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.

## Reactions

**Edwin's Evasive Footwork.** As a reaction to taking damage, Edwin teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that he can see.
