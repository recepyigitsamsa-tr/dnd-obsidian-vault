## Traits

**Death Burst.** If damage reduces the walking delerium geode to 0 hit points, the delerium crystals in its body explode in a burst of contaminated energy, unless the damage was force, radiant, or thunder. Each creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 42 (12d6 damage) necrotic damage and gain one {@adventure level of contamination|DoDk|12}. In addition, this explosion triggers a random arcane anomaly (see Dungeons of Drakkenheim).

**Earth Glide.** The walking delerium geode can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the geode doesn't disturb the material it moves through.
