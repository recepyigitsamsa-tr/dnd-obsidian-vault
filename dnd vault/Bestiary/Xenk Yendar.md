**Multiattack.** Xenk makes three Daggersword attacks and uses Daggersword Flourish. He can replace Daggersword Flourish with Cleansing Touch if it's available.

**Daggersword.** Choose the attack that corresponds to the daggersword's current form (see Daggersword Shift below):

**Longsword.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d8 + 4 damage) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10 + 4 damage) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 6 (1d12 damage) radiant damage.

**Shortsword and Dagger.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 (1d6 + 4 damage) piercing damage plus 6 (1d12 damage) radiant damage.

**Daggersword Flourish.** Choose the option that corresponds to the daggersword's current form (see Daggersword Shift below):

**Longsword.** Xenk magically detaches the longsword's blade from its hilt, launching the blade at a creature he can see within 30 feet of himself. The target must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is impaled by the blade, taking 14 (3d6 + 4 damage) piercing damage, and is knocked prone condition. At the end of the current turn, the blade magically reattaches to its hilt.

**Shortsword and Dagger.** Xenk lashes out with both weapons. Each creature of his choice within 10 feet of him must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (2d6 damage) piercing damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of Xenk's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effect.

**Cleansing Touch (1/Day).** Xenk touches a creature within 5 feet of himself. The target magically regains 27 ({@dice 6d8}) hit points and gains the benefit of a lesser restoration spell spell.
