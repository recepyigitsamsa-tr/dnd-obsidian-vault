## Traits

**Bound Together.** The drowned master shares its mind with every other drowned one within 1 mile of it, and can communicate its thoughts and observations to them instantaneously and without limitation.

**Cold Aura.** At the start of each of the drowned master's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10 damage) cold damage. A creature that touches the drowned master or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10 damage) cold damage.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the drowned master to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the drowned master drops to 1 hit point instead.

**Necrotic Ink {@recharge 5}.** The drowned master discharges foul ink in front of itself in a 30-foot cone.

A creature that fails this saving throw is blinded condition until the end of its next turn and contracts bluerot (see the "Bluerot" in notes).
