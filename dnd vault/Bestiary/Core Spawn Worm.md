**Barbed Tentacles.** {@atk mw} +13 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. {@h}25 (5d6 + 8 damage) piercing damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 18 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition. The tentacles can grapple only one creature at a time.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +13 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}30 (5d8 + 8 damage) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is blinded condition and restrained condition, has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and takes 21 (6d6 damage) fire damage at the start of each of the worm's turns.

If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 21 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone condition in a space within 10 feet of the worm. If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained condition by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone condition.
