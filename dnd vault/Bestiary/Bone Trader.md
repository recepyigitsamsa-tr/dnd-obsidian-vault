**Skelesuck.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}4 (1d4 + 2 damage) piercing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or have one of its bones sucked out, resulting in the piercing damage becoming a reduction in maximum hit points until magical healing is applied.

**Fey Charm.** The bone trader targets one humanoid, goblinoid, fey, or beast it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed condition. The charmed condition creature regards the bone trader as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the bone trader's control, it takes the bone trader's requests or actions in the most favorable way . Each time the bone trader or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the bone trader dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the bone trader's fey charm for the next 24 hours.

The bone trader can have no more than one humanoid charmed condition at a time, along with up to three beasts.
