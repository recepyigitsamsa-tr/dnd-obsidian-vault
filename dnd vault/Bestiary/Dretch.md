**Multiattack.** The dretch makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +2 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}3 (1d6 damage) piercing damage.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} +2 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 (2d4 damage) slashing damage.

**Fetid Cloud (1/Day).** A 10-foot radius of disgusting green gas extends out from the dretch. The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be poisoned condition until the start of its next turn. While poisoned condition in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions.
