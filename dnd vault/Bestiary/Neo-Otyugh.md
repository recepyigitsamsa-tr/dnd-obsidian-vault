**Multiattack.** The neo-otyugh makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its tentacles.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 (2d10 + 5 damage) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned condition until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 ({@dice 1d10}) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

**Tentacle.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}10 (1d10 + 5 damage) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled condition (escape DC 16 Saving Throw) and restrained condition until the grapple ends. The neo-otyugh has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Tentacle Slam.** The neo-otyugh slams creatures grappled condition by it into each other or a solid surface. Each creature must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 15 (3d6 + 5 damage) bludgeoning damage and be stunned condition until the end of the neo-otyugh's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't stunned condition.
