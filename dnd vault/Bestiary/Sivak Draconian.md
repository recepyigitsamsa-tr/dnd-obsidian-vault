## Traits

**Death Throes.** When the draconian is reduced to 0 hit points by a creature that is Large or smaller, the draconian crumbles into dust that then forms a spectral, shrieking image of the creature that killed it. The image lasts for 1 minute. Each creature hostile to the draconian within 10 feet of the image must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be frightened condition of the spectral image for 1 minute. A frightened condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Serrated Sword | +6 to hit | 2d8 + 4 damage) slashing | - |
| Tail | +6 to hit | 1d8 + 4 damage) bludgeoning | - |

**Multiattack.** The draconian makes two Serrated Sword attacks and one Tail attack.

**Serrated Sword.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 (2d8 + 4 damage) slashing damage.

**Tail.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d8 + 4 damage) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be knocked prone condition.

## Reactions

**Shape Theft.** After the draconian kills a Medium or smaller Humanoid, the draconian magically cloaks itself in an illusion to look and feel like that creature while retaining the draconian's game statistics (other than its size). This transformation lasts until the draconian dies or uses a bonus action to end it.
