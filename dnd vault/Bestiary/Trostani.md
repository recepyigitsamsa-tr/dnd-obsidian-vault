**Multiattack.** Trostani takes three actions: she uses Constrict and Touch of Order, and she casts a spell with a casting time of 1 action.

**Constrict.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}15 (3d6 + 5 damage) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 19 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition. Trostani can grapple no more than three targets at a time.

**Touch of Order.** {@atk ms} +16 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}23 (3d8 + 10 damage) radiant damage, and Trostani can choose one magic item she can see in the target's possession. Unless it's an artifact, the item's magic is suppressed until the start of Trostani's next turn.

**Wrath of Mat'Selesnya {@recharge 5}.** Trostani conjures a momentary whirl of branches and vines at a point she can see within 60 feet of her. Each creature in a 30-foot cube on that point must make a DC 24 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6 damage) bludgeoning damage and 21 (6d6 damage) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Legendary Actions

**Voice of Harmony.** Trostani makes one melee attack, with advantage on the attack roll.

**Voice of Life.** Trostani bestows 20 temporary hit points on another creature she can see within 120 feet of her.

**Voice of Order.** Trostani casts dispel magic spell.

**Chorus of the Conclave (Costs 2 Actions).** Trostani casts suggestion spell. This counts as one of her daily uses of the spell.

**Awaken Grove Guardians (Costs 3 Actions).** Trostani animates one or two trees she can see within 120 feet of her, causing them to uproot themselves and become awakened trees (see the Monster Manual for their stat blocks) for 1 minute or until Trostani uses a bonus action to end the effect. These trees understand Druidic and obey Trostani's spoken commands, but can't speak. If she issues no commands to them, the trees do nothing but follow her and take the Dodge action.
