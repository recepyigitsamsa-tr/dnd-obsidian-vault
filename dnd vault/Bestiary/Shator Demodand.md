## Traits

**Boundless Movement.** The shator ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed. It can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically remove the grappled condition condition from itself.

**Jailer (1/Day).** The shator can cast the imprisonment spell spell, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (chaining effect only; spell save DC 18 Saving Throw).

**Liquefaction Ritual.** The shator can perform a 1-minute ritual that turns all willing farastus and kelubars of its choice within 60 feet of itself into a living liquid form. Each liquefied demodand becomes enough liquid to fill a flask. A demodand's liquefaction lasts until a shator uses an action to end it or a creature opens a container holding the liquid. While liquefied in this way, a demodand has the paralyzed condition condition despite any immunity to that condition, it has immunity to all damage, and any curse affecting it is suspended.

**Magic Resistance.** The shator has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Numbing Secretions.** A creature that touches the shator or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls and its speed halved until the end of its next turn.

| Multiattack | - | - | - |

**Multiattack.** The shator makes one Bite attack and two Enervating Trident attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}17 (3d6 + 7 damage) piercing damage plus 26 (4d12 damage) acid damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or have the paralyzed condition condition until the start of the shator's next turn.

**Enervating Trident.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}18 (2d10 + 7 damage) necrotic damage.

**Inhibitory Spray {@recharge 5}.** The shator exhales a spray of slime in a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 40 (9d8 damage) acid damage and has the paralyzed condition condition for 1 minute. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

**Summon Demodand (1/Day).** The shator has a 50 percent chance of summoning its choice of {@dice 1d4} farastu demodands, {@dice 1d2} kelubar demodands, or 1 shator demodand. A summoned demodand appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the shator, acts as an ally of the shator, and can't summon other demodands. It remains for 1 minute, until it or the shator dies, or until the shator dismisses it as an action.
