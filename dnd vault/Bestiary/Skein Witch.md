**Multiattack.** The skein witch makes three Inexorable Thread attacks. If two Inexorable Thread attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on the next death saving throw it makes before it finishes a short rest. If a creature fails this saving throw multiple times, these effects are cumulative, affecting up to three of the creature's next death saving throws before it finishes a short rest.

**Inexorable Thread.** {@atk ms,rs} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one creature. {@h}27 (5d8 + 5 damage) radiant damage.

**Destiny Distortion Wave {@recharge 5}.** The skein witch frays the strands of fate in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw, taking 55 (10d10 damage) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If any creature that failed the saving throw is affected by a condition, such as incapacitated condition or poisoned condition, those conditions are randomly redistributed among all the creatures that failed the saving throw.

**Bind Fates (1/Day).** One creature within 60 feet of the skein witch must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or the target's fate is bound to one of its ally's (chosen at random). Any damage or condition the target suffers is inflicted on the individual to which they are bound instead, and vice versa. A creature can be bound to only one other creature at a time. This binding lasts until lifted by a heal or heroes' feast spell spell or similar magic.

## Reactions

**Parry Spell.** If the skein witch succeeds on a saving throw against a spell of 4th level or lower that targets only the skein witch, the spell has no effect. If the skein witch succeeds on the saving throw by 5 or more, the spell is reflected back at the spellcaster, using the slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.
