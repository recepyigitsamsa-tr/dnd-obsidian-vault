## Traits

**Formed by the Mists.** When created, the horror's body composition takes one of four forms: Aberrant Armor, Loathsome Limbs, Malleable Mass, or Oozing Organs. This form determines certain traits in this stat block.

**Amorphous (Malleable Mass Only).** The horror can move through any opening at least 1 inch wide without squeezing.

**Bile Body (Oozing Organs Only).** Any creature that touches the horror or hits it with a melee attack takes 5 (1d10 damage) acid damage.

**Relentless Stride (Loathsome Limbs Only).** The horror can move through the space of another creature. The first time on a turn that the horror enters a creature's space during this move, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be knocked prone condition.
