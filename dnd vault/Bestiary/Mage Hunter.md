## Traits

**Multiattack (Hunter Form Only).** The hunter makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw (Hunter Form Only).** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 (2d10 + 4 damage) slashing damage.

**Tail.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}22 (4d8 + 4 damage) piercing damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 15 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition, and the hunter can't make a Tail attack against another target.

**Mage Tracker (Sentry Form Only).** The hunter emits a pulse of energy that helps it better locate its magical quarry. Each creature within 120 feet of the hunter that has the ability to cast spells must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be mystically marked by the hunter for 1 hour.

While marked, a creature can't become hidden from the hunter and gains no benefit from the invisible condition condition against the hunter. Additionally, while a marked creature is on the same plane of existence as the hunter, the hunter always knows the distance and direction to the creature.

## Reactions

**Consume and Destroy.** When the hunter takes damage from a spell, it takes only half the triggering damage (rounded down). If the creature that cast the spell is within 60 feet of the hunter, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take the other half of the damage.
