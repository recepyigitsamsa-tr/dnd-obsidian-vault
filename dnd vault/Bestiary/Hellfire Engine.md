**Flesh-Crushing Stride.** The hellfire engine moves up to its speed in a straight line. During this move, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. A creature whose space the hellfire engine enters must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to the nearest space out of the hellfire engine's path. On a failed save, the creature falls prone condition and takes 28 (8d6 damage) bludgeoning damage.

If the hellfire engine remains in the prone condition creature's space, the creature is also restrained condition until it's no longer in the same space as the hellfire engine. While restrained condition in this way, the creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 18 Saving Throw Strength check. On a success, the creature is shunted to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the hellfire engine and is no longer restrained condition.

**Hellfire Weapons.** The hellfire engine uses one of the following options:

If the chosen option kills a creature, the creature's soul rises from the River Styx as a lemure in Avernus in {@dice 1d4} hours. If the creature isn't revived before then, only a wish spell spell or killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature's original body can restore it to life. Constructs and devils are immune to this effect.
