**Multiattack.** The matriarch makes two claws attacks.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 (3d6 + 3 damage) slashing damage.

**Fleeting Form.** The matriarch can magically disguise itself to resemble a humanoid of roughly similar size and shape for up to 1 hour. It can revert to its true form as a bonus action. This illusion does not hold up to close scrutiny.

**Luring Song.** The matriarch sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the matriarch that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be charmed condition until the song ends. The matriarch must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the matriarch is incapacitated condition.

While charmed condition by the matriarch, a target is incapacitated condition and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed condition target is more than 5 feet away from the matriarch, the target must move on its turn toward the matriarch by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the matriarch, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed condition target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

A target that successfully saves is immune to this matriarch's song for the next 24 hours.

**Visage of Desire (1/Day).** The matriarch projects a vision into the minds of creatures within 30 feet of it that aren't constructs or undead, showing each creature achieving whatever it most desires. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become paralyzed condition until the end of its next turn.
