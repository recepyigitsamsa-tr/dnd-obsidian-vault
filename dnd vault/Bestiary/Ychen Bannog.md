**Deafening Bellow {@recharge 5}.** The ychen bannog delivers a fearsome bellow in a 60-foot cone that is audible out to 1 mile. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 44 (8d10 damage) thunder damage and is deafened condition for 1 hour.
