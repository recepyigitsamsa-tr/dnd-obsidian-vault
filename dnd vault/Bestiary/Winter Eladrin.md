## Traits

**Fey Step {@recharge 4}.** As a bonus action, the eladrin can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

**Magic Resistance.** The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Sorrowful Presence.** Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed condition for 1 minute. While charmed condition in this way, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws. The charmed condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to any eladrin's Sorrowful Presence for the next 24 hours.

Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the charmed condition creature, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
