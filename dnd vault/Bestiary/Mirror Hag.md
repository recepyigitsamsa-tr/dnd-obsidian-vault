## Traits

**Confounding Ugliness.** Any Humanoid that starts its turn within 60 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated condition until the start of its next turn. If the Humanoid's saving throw is successful, it is immune to the hag's Confounding Ugliness for the next 24 hours.

Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the Humanoid does so, it can't see the hag until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the Humanoid looks at the hag in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
