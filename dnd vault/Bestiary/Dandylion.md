**Rejuvenating Seedpods (2/Day).** The dandylion releases a burst of seedpods from its tail, filling a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature of the dandylion's choice in the sphere can immediately end one of the following conditions on itself (creature's choice): blinded condition, deafened condition, paralyzed condition, or poisoned condition. In addition, all soil in the sphere's area is enriched, restoring withered vegetation in the area to full health and causing all crops in the area to produce twice the normal harvest for the next year.

The creature that triggered this reaction must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or have the frightened condition condition until the end of the dandylion's next turn.
