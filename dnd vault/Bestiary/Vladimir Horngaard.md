**Rejuvenation.** When Vladimir's body is destroyed, his soul lingers. After 24 hours, the soul inhabits and animates another corpse on the same plane of existence and regains all its hit points. While the soul is bodiless, a wish spell spell can be used to force the soul to go to the afterlife and not return.

**Turn Immunity.** Vladimir is immune to effects that turn undead.

**Vengeful Tracker.** Vladimir knows the distance to and direction of Strahd, even if Strahd and Vladimir are on different planes of existence. If Strahd is destroyed, Vladimir knows.
