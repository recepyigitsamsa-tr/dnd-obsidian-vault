## Traits

**Enforce Good Deeds.** A creature that has received assistance, such as healing or a glowing feather, from the firebird must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the geas spell spell for 30 days. While under the geas, the affected creature must assist nonhostile creatures suffering from starvation or thirst by alleviating the starvation or thirst.

**Fiery Weapons.** The firebird's weapon attacks are magical. When the firebird hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 damage fire damage (included in the attack).

**Glowing Feathers.** The firebird sheds bright light in a 5- to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius. The firebird can alter the radius as a bonus action. If the firebird willingly gifts a feather to a creature, the feather sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet indefinitely.

**Magic Resistance.** The firebird has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Warming Presence.** The firebird and each creature within 5 feet of it are immune to the effects of cold environments, provided the cold is caused by naturally occurring weather and climate. When the firebird is inside a structure, it can choose for this trait to affect all creatures within the structure (no action required), regardless of how close they are to it.
