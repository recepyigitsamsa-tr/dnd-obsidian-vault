| Lignify | DC 13 | - | - |

**Multiattack.** The barkburr makes two Poison Barb attacks and uses Lignify if able.

**Poison Barb.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}5 (1d4 + 3 damage) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) poison damage, and the barkburr attaches to the target. While the barkburr is attached, it can't make Poison Barb attacks, and the target has the restrained condition condition as its body begins to transform into wood.

An attached barkburr can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. A creature that can reach the barkburr, including the target, can use its action to detach the barkburr by making a successful DC 13 Saving Throw Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check.

**Lignify.** The barkburr targets the creature it is attached to, and the target must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the petrified condition condition until freed by the Greater Restoration spell spell or another effect, except it turns into a tree instead of stone. Any equipment the target is wearing or carrying is absorbed into the tree's bark.
