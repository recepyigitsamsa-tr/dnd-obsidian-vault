## Traits

**Alternate Forms.** The gingwatzim has two alternate forms, both of which are chosen by its creator when the gingwatzim comes into being. One form is an exact duplicate of a Tiny nonmagical object (such as a book, dagger, or gemstone) that its creator is carrying or wearing when the gingwatzim is conjured. The other form can be any Tiny beast. Once these alternate forms are chosen, they can't be changed.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Energy Drain (True Form Only) | +4 to hit | 4d6 + 2 damage) necrotic | - |
| Change Shape | - | - | - |

**Energy Drain (True Form Only).** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}16 (4d6 + 2 damage) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion condition. When the target finishes a short or long rest, the target loses every level of exhaustion condition gained from this attack.

**Change Shape.** The gingwatzim changes from its true form—a 3-foot-diameter sphere of luminous ectoplasm—into one of its two alternate forms, or from one of those forms back into its true form. In object form, it can't move or make attacks but otherwise retains its statistics, and it is indistinguishable from the thing it is imitating. In beast form, it retains its hit points but otherwise uses the stat block of the beast it is imitating. When it dies, the gingwatzim reverts to its true form and then vanishes.
