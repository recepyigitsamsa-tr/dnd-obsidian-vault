## Traits

**Toxic Smoke.** If the venomous mummy takes fire damage, each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 12 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw as its venom-soaked wraps emit a poisonous smoke. On a failure, a creature takes 7 (2d6 damage) poison damage and is poisoned condition until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned condition. The smoke fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the mummy. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until the end of the mummy's next turn. A creature that enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there is poisoned condition until the end of its next turn.

**Venom-Soaked Wraps.** A creature that touches the mummy or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6 damage) poison damage.

**Undead Nature.** The venomous mummy doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
