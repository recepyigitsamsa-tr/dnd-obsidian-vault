## Traits

**Force Field.** Tockworth generates a magical force field around herself. This force field has 15 hit points and regains all its hit points at the start of each of Tockworth's turns, but it ceases to function if Tockworth drops to 0 hit points. Any damage Tockworth takes is subtracted from the force field's hit points first. Each time the force field regains hit points, the following conditions end on Tockworth: grappled condition, restrained condition, and stunned condition.
