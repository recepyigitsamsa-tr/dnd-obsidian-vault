## Traits

**Elemental Affinity.** The dragonleaf tree has immunity to a type of damage based on the type of dragon that grew it: acid (black, copper), cold (silver, white), fire (brass, gold, red), lightning (blue, bronze), or poison (green).

**Eternally Loyal.** The dragonleaf tree has advantage on ability checks and saving throws against influence or effects that would encourage it or force it to act against its draconic master.
