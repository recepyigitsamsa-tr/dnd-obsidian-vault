## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|

| Bite | +4 to hit | 1d10 + 2 damage) piercing | - |
| Ovipositor | +4 to hit | 1d6 damage piercing | - |

**Multiattack.** The assassin bug makes two bite attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}7 (1d10 + 2 damage) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be poisoned condition for 1 minute. While poisoned condition this way, the target is paralyzed condition. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Ovipositor.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}The target is infested with {@dice 1d3} assassin bug eggs, which immediately hatch into assassin bug maggots. At the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes 1d6 damage piercing damage per maggot infesting it. Applying fire to the bite wound before the end of the target's next turn deals 1 fire damage to the target and kills these assassin bug maggots. After this time, the maggots are too far under the skin to be burned.

If a target infested by assassin bug maggots ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the maggots burrow into its heart and kill it. Any effect that cures disease kills all assassin bug maggots infesting the target.
