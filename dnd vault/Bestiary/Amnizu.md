**Multiattack.** The amnizu uses Poison Mind. It also makes two attacks: one with its whip and one with its Disruptive Touch.

**Taskmaster Whip.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}10 (2d4 + 5 damage) slashing damage plus 33 (6d10 damage) force damage.

**Disruptive Touch.** {@atk ms} +11 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}44 (8d10 damage) necrotic damage.

**Poison Mind.** The amnizu targets one or two creatures that it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 19 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or take 26 (4d12 damage) necrotic damage and is blinded condition until the start of the amnizu's next turn.

**Forgetfulness {@recharge}.** The amnizu targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. That creature must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Intelligence saving throw and on a failure the target is stunned condition for 1 minute. A stunned condition creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target remains stunned condition for the full minute, it forgets everything it sensed, experienced, and learned during the last 5 hours.

## Reactions

**Instinctive Charm.** When a creature within 60 feet of the amnizu makes an attack roll against it, and another creature is within the attack's range, the attacker must make a DC 19 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including the amnizu or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. If the saving throw is successful, the attacker is immune to the amnizu's Instinctive Charm for 24 hours.
