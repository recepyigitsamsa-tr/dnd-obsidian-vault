The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried, and it destroys the balor's weapons.

**Fire Aura.** At the start of each of the balor's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6 damage) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the balor or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6 damage) fire damage.
