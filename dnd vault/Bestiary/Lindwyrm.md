**Multiattack.** The lindwyrm makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. The lindwyrm can substitute a swallow attack for one of its claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}22 (3d10 + 6 damage) piercing damage and the target must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, takingÂ 18 (4d8 damage) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a hit, the target is also grappled condition (escape DC 18 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition, and the lindwyrm can't bite another target.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}15 (2d8 + 6 damage) slashing damage.

**Swallow.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one Huge or smaller creature the lindwyrm is grappling. {@h}22 (3d10 + 6 damage) piercing damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded condition and restrained condition, it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside the lindwyrm, and it takes 27 (6d8 damage) acid damage at the start of each of the lindwyrm's turns. The lindwyrm can have only one target swallowed at a time.

If the lindwyrm takes 40 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the lindwyrm must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone condition in a space within 10 feet of the lindwyrm. If the lindwyrm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained condition by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone condition.

**Burrowing Rush (Costs 2 Actions).** The lindwyrm burrows its speed and comes up beneath a target touching the ground, making a bite attack. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
