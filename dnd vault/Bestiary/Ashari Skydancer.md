## Traits

**Evasion.** If the skydancer is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw} to take only half damage, the skydancer instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw}, and only half damage if it fails.

**Flyby.** The skydancer doesn't provoke an {@action opportunity attack|PHB} when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Skysail.** The skydancer flies with a special Ashari magic item called a skysail|TDCSR. While the skysail|TDCSR|skysail's wings are extended, the skydancer can glide through the air at a speed of 60 feet, but must descend by at least 10 feet at the end of its turn and can't gain altitude.

| Skysail Staff | +7 to hit | 1d6 + 4 damage) bludgeoning | - |
| Fly (1/Day) | - | - | - |

**Multiattack.** The skydancer makes two skysail|TDCSR staff attacks.

**Skysail Staff.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 (1d6 + 4 damage) bludgeoning damage. If the skydancer makes this attack while flying, the target must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Dexterity {@quickref saving throws|PHB|2|1|saving throw}, taking 21 (6d6 damage) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Fly (1/Day).** The skydancer uses its skysail|TDCSR to cast fly spell on itself for up to 1 minute (no {@status concentration} required).

## Reactions

**Slow Fall.** When the skydancer takes {@quickref falling|XGE|2|0|falling damage}, it can reduce the damage by half.
