## Traits

**Horrid Plant Varieties.** A horrid plant comes in one of three varieties (choose or roll a {@dice d6}): 1-2, dew drinker; 3-4, purple blossom; or 5-6, snapper saw. This form determines certain traits in this stat block.

**False Appearance.** If the horrid plant is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the horrid plant move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check to discern that the horrid plant isn't an ordinary plant.
