**Multiattack.** The golem makes two slam attacks.

**Ruidium Dart.** The golem can conjure a magic dart made of ruidium and hurl it at another creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The dart strikes the target unerringly and vanishes on contact. The target must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 24 (7d6 damage) psychic damage and gains 1 level of exhaustion condition. In addition, if the target is not already suffering from ruidium corruption, it becomes corrupted when it fails the saving throw. On a successful saving throw, the target takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}19 (3d8 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage.

**Slow {@recharge 5}.** The golem targets one or more creatures it can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
