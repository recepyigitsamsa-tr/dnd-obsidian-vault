**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hp or gain temporary hp.

**Weight of Wings.** A creature that starts its turn in the swarm's space has its speed halved and must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or become blinded condition.
