**Fire Aura.** At the start of each of the tlexolotl's turns, each creature within 10 feet of it takes 7 (2d6 damage) fire damage, and flammable objects in that aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the tlexolotl or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6 damage) fire damage.

**Illumination.** The tlexolotl sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

**Regeneration.** The tlexolotl regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the tlexolotl takes cold damage or is immersed in water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the tlexolotl's next turn. The tlexolotl dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
