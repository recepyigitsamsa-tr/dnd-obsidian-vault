**Lightning Fist.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}25 (4d8 + 7 damage) lightning damage.

**Hailstone.** {@atk rw} +12 to hit to hit, range 90/180 ft., one target. {@h}17 (3d6 + 7 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) cold damage.

**Death Bolt {@recharge 5}.** The spirit hurls a magical lightning bolt in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8 damage) lightning damage plus 16 (3d10 damage) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a success or failure, an affected creature's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The creature dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.
