## Traits

**Ever Connected.** Fidele angels are magically connected. Damage taken by the fidele angel is split evenly between the fidele angel and its paired fidele angel. The angel that was the original target of the attack takes any damage that won't divide evenly. All other effects, such as reducing ability scores or being the target of a bless spell spell, affect only the target.

**Immortal Nature.** The fidele angel doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.

**Magic Resistance.** The angel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The angel's weapon attacks are magical.

**Unshakeable Fidelity.** No spell, feature, trait, magic, or other effect can cause a fidele angel to act against or harm its mate or change its love or loyalty toward its mate.
