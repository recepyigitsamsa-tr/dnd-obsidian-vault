**Multiattack.** The Moonlit King makes three Crystal Staff or Moon Bolt attacks. He can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting. If two Crystal Staff attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 19 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be stunned condition until the end of its next turn.

**Crystal Staff.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d6 + 5 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6 damage) radiant damage.

**Moon Bolt.** {@atk rs} +11 to hit to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}27 (4d10 + 5 damage) radiant damage, and the target sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius until the end of its next turn. If the target is a creature in a form other than its true form, it takes an extra 11 (2d10 damage) radiant damage and must succeed on a DC 19 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw or revert to its true form.

**Animate Shadows {@recharge 5}.** The Moonlit King causes the shadows of up to three creatures he can see within 60 feet of him to animate and attack their owners. Each target must make a DC 19 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 49 (14d6 damage) necrotic damage, and its Strength score is reduced by {@dice 1d4}. On a success, a creature takes half the damage, and its Strength score isn't reduced. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The creature dies if this effect reduces its Strength to 0.

**Summon Devil (1/Day).** The Moonlit King magically calls a lunar devil to aid him. The devil arrives in {@dice 1d4} rounds, acting as ally of the Moonlit King and obeying his spoken commands. The devil remains for 1 hour, until the Moonlit King dies, or until the King dismisses it as a bonus action.

## Legendary Actions

**Move.** The Moonlit King moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Shift Moonlight.** The Moonlit King changes the brightness of each area of moonlight he can see within 120 feet of him from dim light to bright light or vice versa.

**Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The Moonlit King makes a Crystal Staff or Moon Bolt attack.

**Spread Madness (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature within 30 feet of the Moonlit King must succeed on a DC 19 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or suffer short-term madness. The Moonlit King can use this legendary action only when he is in moonlight.


## Reactions

**Shadow Slip.** When a creature the Moonlit King can see within 30 feet of him attacks him, he takes on the quality of his manifest delusions, temporarily becoming ghostly. The attack roll has disadvantage, and if it hits, the Moonlit King takes only half the damage from the attack.
