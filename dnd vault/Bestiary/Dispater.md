## Traits

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede Dispater's darkvision.

**Fear Aura.** When a creature starts their turn within 120 feet of Dispater, they must succeed on a DC 22 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or have the frightened condition condition until they leave the aura. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this effect for 1 hour.

**Fiendish Regeneration.** Dispater regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes radiant damage this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Dispater dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and is unable to regenerate.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Dispater fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Dispater has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Rust Metal.** Any nonmagical weapon or ammunition made of metal that hits Dispater corrodes. After its hit, the weapon or ammunition is destroyed.

**Multiattack.** Dispater makes four attacks using his Wrought- Iron Tower, Iron Column, or a combination of the two. He can replace one of the attacks with Superheat Metal (if available).

**Wrought-Iron Tower.** {@atk mw} +20 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}21 (2d8 + 12 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) fire damage. Dispater may replace the bludgeoning damage with damage of a type that the target is vulnerable to instead.

**Superheat Metal {@recharge 4}.** Dispater targets a metal object he can see within 90 feet of him. The metal glows white-hot, burning all that touches it. If the object was held by a creature, the creature must succeed on a DC 23 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw to drop the object or take 45 (10d8 damage) fire damage. If the object is attached to a creature, or they couldn't feasibly drop it, they automatically fail the save. The object returns to room temperature at the end of Dispater's turn.

**Nail Spray (2/Day).** Dispater conjures a storm of iron nails and launches them forward in a 90-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line. All creatures within the line must make a DC 23 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 40 (16d4 damage) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Nails launched from this ability stick into soft surfaces or fall to the ground after the attack finishes.
