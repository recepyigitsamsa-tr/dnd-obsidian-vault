**Head Butts.** {@atk mw} +0 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 (4d4 damage) bludgeoning damage, or 5 (2d4 damage) bludgeoning damage if the swarm has half its hit points or fewer.

**Spores (1/Day).** A 20-foot radius of spores extends from the swarm. These spores can go around corners, and they have no effect on Constructs, Elementals, Plants, or Undead. Each other creature in the area must make a DC 10 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated condition and its speed is halved, both for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
