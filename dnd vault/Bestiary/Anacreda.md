**Multiattack.** Anacreda makes two Claw attacks. She can replace one of the attacks with a Crushing Hug attack.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +13 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}16 (2d8 + 7 damage) slashing damage.

**Crushing Hug.** {@atk mw} +13 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}51 (8d10 + 7 damage) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, Anacreda grabs it with both arms. The target has the grappled condition condition (escape DC 18 Saving Throw). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 73 (12d10 + 7 damage) necrotic damage at the start of each of Anacreda's turns. Anacreda can't make attacks while grappling a creature in this way.

**Spinewall.** Anacreda causes a 50-foot-long, 5-foot-wide row of bones to pierce the earth at a point within 120 feet of her. She chooses the direction of the line. The bones rise 10 feet into the air and form a solid wall. A 5-foot section of bone has an AC of 20 and 10 hit points.

**Shattering Shriek (1/Day).** Anacreda shrieks loud enough to shatter stone and bone alike. Each creature within a 50-foot-radius sphere centered on Anacreda must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 55 (10d10 damage) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Unworked stone, exposed bone, and similar materials in the radius are shattered and turned into difficult terrain.
