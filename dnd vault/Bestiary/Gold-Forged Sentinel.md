## Traits

**Charge.** If the sentinel moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6 damage) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be knocked prone condition.

**Spell Turning.** The sentinel has advantage on saving throws against any spell that targets only the sentinel (not an area). If the sentinel's saving throw succeeds and the spell is of 4th level or lower, the spell has no effect on the sentinel and instead targets the caster.
