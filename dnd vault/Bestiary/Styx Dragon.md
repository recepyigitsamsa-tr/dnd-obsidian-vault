**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks using its Bite, Tail, or a combination of the two. It can replace one of the attacks with Constrict.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +14 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}19 (2d10 + 8 damage) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) poison damage, and the target must make a DC 19 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target contracts Stygian Wasting.

**Tail.** {@atk mw} +14 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}15 (2d6 + 8 damage) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the grappled condition condition (escape DC 22 Saving Throw). The dragon can't make a Tail attack while a creature is grappled condition in this way.

**Constrict.** The dragon tightens its grip on a creature grappled condition by its tail. The creature takes 27 (3d12 + 8 damage) bludgeoning damage, has the restrained condition condition until the start of the dragon's next turn, and must make a DC 19 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target contracts Stygian Wasting.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or have the frightened condition condition for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Stygian Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales poisonous Styx water in a 60-foot-long, 10-foot-wide line. Each creature in that line must make a DC 19 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8 damage) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save contract Stygian Wasting.

## Legendary Actions

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a Tail attack. If a creature is already grappled condition, the dragon may use Constrict instead.

**Death Throw (Costs 3 Actions).** If the dragon has successfully restrained condition a creature with the Constrict ability, it may throw them up to 100 feet away. When it lands, the creature takes 21 (6d6 damage) bludgeoning damage and must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the unconscious condition condition for 10 minutes.
