**White Ghost Shivers.** A creature that eats the meat of the bone crab or that is bitten by a creature infected with the white ghost shivers disease must succeed on a DC 11 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or become infected with the disease. An infected creature develops the first symptoms after 24 hours. Symptoms include a mild chill that escalates to a fever and frightful hallucinations that give the disease its name. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 11 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion condition. The exhaustion condition lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws against the disease recovers from it. Alternatively, the disease can be removed by the lesser restoration spell spell or similar magic.
