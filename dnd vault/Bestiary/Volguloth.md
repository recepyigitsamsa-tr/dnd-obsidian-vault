## Traits

**Glide.** The volguloth has draping skin that it can expand while falling to slow its rate of descent to 60 feet per round, landing on its feet and taking no falling damage. It can move up to 5 feet horizontally for every 1 foot it falls. The volguloth can't gain height with its expanded skin alone. If subjected to a strong wind or lift of any kind, it can use the updraft to glide farther.

**Magic Resistance.** The volguloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Poisoned Weapons.** The volguloth's weapons are coated with a magical poison. When the volguloth hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 damage poison damage (included in the attack).
