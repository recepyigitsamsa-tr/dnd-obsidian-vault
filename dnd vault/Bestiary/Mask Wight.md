The object or location can't be an object on the target or a location within its sight when it fails this saving throw.

**Wail of the Forgotten {@recharge}.** The mask wight emits an earâ€‘piercing wail. Each creature within 30 feet of the mask wight must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6 damage) thunder damage and 27 (6d8 damage) psychic damage and is deafened condition for 1 hour. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't deafened condition. A creature killed by this wail is erased from the memories of every creature in the planes that ever saw or interacted with it, all written or pictorial references to the target fade away, and its body is obliterated. Only divine beings and creatures that saw the creature die are unaffected by this memory erasure. The slain creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell spell.
