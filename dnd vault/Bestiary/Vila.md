## Traits

**Forest's Defender.** Difficult terrain composed of nonmagical plants doesn't cost the vila extra movement, and it can pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, while in forested terrain, the vila has advantage on initiative rolls.

**Poisoned Weapons.** The vila's weapons are coated with a magical poison harvest from the forest. When the vila hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 damage poison damage (included in the attack).

**Speak with Beasts.** The vila can communicate with Beasts as if they shared a language.
