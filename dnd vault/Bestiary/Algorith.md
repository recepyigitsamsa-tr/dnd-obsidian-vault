|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |

**Multiattack.** The algorith makes three Logic Razor attacks, or it makes two Logic Razor attacks and uses Spellcasting.

**Logic Razor.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}21 (3d10 + 5 damage) force damage.

**Cone of Negation {@recharge 5}.** The algorith projects null energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 33 (6d10 damage) force damage and any spell of 4th level or lower on the creature ends, as if it had been the target of a dispel magic spell spell. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and spells on it don't end.

**Reality Bomb (5/Day).** The algorith summons and throws a tiny rune of law at a point it can see within 100 feet. The rune explodes on impact. Each creature within 30 feet of where the rune landed must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 27 (5d10 damage) force damage and is stunned condition until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't stunned condition.
