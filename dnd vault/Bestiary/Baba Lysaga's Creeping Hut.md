## Traits

**Constructed Nature.** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

**Antimagic Susceptibility.** The hut is incapacitated condition while the magic gem that animates it is in the area of an antimagic field spell. If targeted by dispel magic spell, the hut must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious condition for 1 minute.

**Siege Monster.** The hut deals double damage to objects and structures.
