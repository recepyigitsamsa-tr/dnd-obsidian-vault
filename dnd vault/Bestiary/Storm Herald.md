If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the grappled condition condition (escape DC 18 Saving Throw). It also has the restrained condition condition and takes 16 (3d10 damage) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns until this grapple ends. The herald can have only one creature grappled condition this way at a time.

**Psychic Wave {@recharge}.** The herald unleashes a blast of psionic energy into the minds of up to three creatures it can see within 90 feet of itself. Each target must make a DC 21 Saving Throw Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 23 (3d10 + 7 damage) psychic damage and has the stunned condition condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this psychic damage, it dies and its head explodes if it has one.
