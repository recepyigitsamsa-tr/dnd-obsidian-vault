## Traits

**Fungal Aura.** A creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of a mindrot thrall must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or become infected with the mindrot disease.

**Mindrot.** A creature infected with this disease manifests symptoms in {@dice 1d4} days after infection, which include migraines and muscle weakness. Until the disease is cured, at the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8 damage) acid damage, and its hp maximum is reduced by that amount. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0. One day after the creature dies, it rises as a mindrot thrall. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws recovers from the disease.
