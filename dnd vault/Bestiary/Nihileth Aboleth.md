## Traits

**Ghostly Body (Void Ghost Form Only).** The nihileth has resistance to acid, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, it has immunity to the prone condition condition, and it has immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. In addition, the nihileth can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10 damage) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Infecting Telepathy.** If a creature communicates telepathically with the nihileth, or deals psychic damage to it, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or become infected with the nihilethic rot disease.

**Nihilethic Rot.** This disease takes 1 minute to manifest in an infected creature, during which time the disease can be removed with the lesser restoration spell spell. After 1 minute, the creature's flesh becomes slimy and translucent, and the disease can be cured only by the heal spell spell or similar magic. Until this disease is cured, the creature can't regain hp unless it is submerged in water, and it can breathe air and water. The creature must be submerged in water at least once every 2 hours to avoid suffocating, and if it is outside a body of water, it takes 7 (2d6 damage) acid damage every 10 minutes, unless moisture is applied to its skin before 10 minutes have passed. If a Humanoid dies while infected with this disease, it rises 1 minute later as a nihilethic zombie under the nihileth's control. If a Large giant or monstrosity dies while infected with this disease, it rises 1 minute later as a nihilethic dominator under the nihileth's control.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the nihileth to 0 hp, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the nihileth drops to 1 hp instead.

**Undead Nature.** The nihileth doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Void Aura.** The nihileth is surrounded by a chilling cloud. A creature that isn't a construct or undead and that starts its turn within 5 feet of the nihileth must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or its speed is halved until the start of its next turn. In addition, a creature infected with nihilethic rot takes 7 (2d6 damage) cold damage when it starts its turn within this aura.
