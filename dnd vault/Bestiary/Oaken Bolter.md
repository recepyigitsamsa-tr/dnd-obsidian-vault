**Multiattack.** The oaken bolter makes two lancing bolt attacks or one lancing bolt attack and one harpoon attack.

**Lancing Bolt.** {@atk mw,rw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 100/400 ft., one target. {@h}15 (2d10 + 4 damage) piercing damage.

**Harpoon.** {@atk rw} +7 to hit to hit, range 50/200 ft., one target. {@h}9 (1d10 + 4 damage) piercing damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 12 Saving Throw). While grappled condition in this way, a creature's speed isn't reduced, but it can move only in directions that bring it closer to the oaken bolter. A creature takes 5 (1d10 damage) slashing damage if it escapes from the grapple or if it tries and fails. As a bonus action, the oaken bolter can pull a creature grappled condition by it 20 feet closer. The oaken bolter can grapple only one creature at a time.

**Explosive Bolt {@recharge 5}.** The oaken bolter launches an explosive charge at a point within 120 feet. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6 damage) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
