## Traits

**Creature Sense.** The refraction is aware of creatures within 100 miles of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each one's Intelligence score, but can't sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a mind blank spell spell, a nondetection spell spell, or similar magic can't be perceived in this manner.

**Incorporeal Movement.** The refraction can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10 damage) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Legendary Resistance (5/Day).** If the refraction fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The refraction has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
