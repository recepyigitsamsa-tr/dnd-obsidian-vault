## Traits

**Spellcasting Animosity.** If the white ape sees a creature cast a spell, the ape has advantage on attack rolls against that creature on the ape's next turn.

**Arcane Wasting.** Characterized by the slow mental deterioration it causes, arcane wasting is a disease that infects Humanoids and spreads through spellcasting. A creature infected with this disease manifests symptoms {@dice 1d4} days after infection, which include brain fog and difficulty recalling memories. Until the disease is cured, at the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or its Intelligence and Wisdom scores are each reduced by {@dice 1d2}. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces a creature's Intelligence or Wisdom to 0, the creature dies. If the infected creature casts a spell on a Humanoid before the disease is cured, and the Humanoid is hit by the spell or fails the saving throw, that Humanoid must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the arcane wasting disease.

**Magic Resistance.** The white ape has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Multiattack.** The white ape makes one Bite attack and two Fist attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 (2d8 + 4 damage) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or contract the arcane wasting disease (see the Arcane Wasting trait).

**Fist.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 (2d10 + 4 damage) bludgeoning damage.

**Frenzy {@recharge 5}.** The white ape lashes out wildly at nearby creatures, flailing and biting. Each creature within 10 feet of the white ape must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6 damage) bludgeoning damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the ape. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't pushed. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw also has advantage on attack rolls against the white ape until the end of its next turn.
