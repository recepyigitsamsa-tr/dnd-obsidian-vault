**Grasping Slam.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}17 (2d10 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 17 Saving Throw) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition and takes 9 (2d8 damage) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns, and the herald can't use its Grasping Slam on another target.

**Blood Bolt.** {@atk rs} +7 to hit to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}25 (5d8 + 3 damage) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature with blood, it must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be poisoned condition until the end of its next turn.

**Call Blood {@recharge 5}.** Each creature with blood within 10 feet of the herald must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (10d8 damage) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The herald then gains temporary hp equal to the single highest amount of necrotic damage dealt. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more also suffers one level of exhaustion condition.
