**Bite.** {@atk mw} +14 to hit to hit; reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}18 (3d6 + 8 damage) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) necrotic damage.

**Beating Wings.** The dragon beats its great wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 21 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (1d4 + 8 damage) bludgeoning damage, be pushed 10 feet away from the dragon, and have the prone condition condition.

**Harmful Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales putrid gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6 damage) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The dragon then chooses a point it can see where the cone makes contact with the ground. That point becomes the center of a 10-foot-high, 10-foot-radius cylinder of lingering gas that disappears at the start of the dragon's next turn. Any creature that starts its turn in the cylinder takes 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage.
