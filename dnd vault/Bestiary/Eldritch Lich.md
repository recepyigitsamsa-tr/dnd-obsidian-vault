## Traits

**Far Realm Parasite.** Inside the lich's torso dwells a wormlike parasite that contains the lich's soul. When the lich dies, it implodes into the parasite, which then vanishes into the Far Realm. In {@dice 2d4} days, the parasite causes the lich to reappear within {@dice 1d4} miles of where it died. If the lich died inside a magic circle cast to contain Undead, the lich instead reappears as an otyugh with all the lich's memories.

**Legendary Resistance (4/Day).** If the lich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Unusual Nature.** The lich doesn't need air, food, drink, or sleep.
