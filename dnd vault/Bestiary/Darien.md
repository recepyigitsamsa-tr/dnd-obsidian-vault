**Multiattack.** Darien makes two War Pick attacks.

**War Pick.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. {@h}10 (1d8 + 6 damage) piercing damage plus 4 necrotic damage.

**Eldritch Blast.** {@atk rs} +8 to hit to hit, range 300 ft., three targets. {@h}9 (1d10 + 4 damage) force damage.

**Create Thrall.** Darien touches an incapacitated condition Humanoid. That creature is then charmed condition by her until a remove curse spell spell is cast on it, the charmed condition condition is removed from it, or she uses this feature again. Darien can communicate telepathically with the charmed condition creature as long as the two of them are on the same plane of existence.

**Summon War Pick.** Darien creates a magical war pick in her empty hand. The war pick counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The war pick has a +1 bonus to attack and damage (already factored into Darien's attacks).

## Reactions

**Shield of Cryonax (1/Day).** When Darien takes damage, she can entomb herself in ice, which melts away at the end of her next turn. She gains 150 temporary hit points, which take as much of the triggering damage as possible. Immediately after she takes the damage, she gains vulnerability to fire damage, her speed is reduced to 0, and she is incapacitated condition. These effects, including any remaining temporary hit points, all end when the ice melts.
