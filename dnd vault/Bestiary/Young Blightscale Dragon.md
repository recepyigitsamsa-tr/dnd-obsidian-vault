## Traits

**Accursed Death.** When the dragon dies, it exudes a cloud of sickening, accursed gas. Each creature within 20 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or become poisoned condition for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. However, a creature that fails two of these saving throws becomes cursed. A creature cursed in this way takes 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage and can't regain hit points, and the creature's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. Every 24 hours, the cursed creature takes 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage with similar reduction to the creature's hit point maximum. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies.
