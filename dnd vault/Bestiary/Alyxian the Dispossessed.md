## Traits

**Divinely Blessed.** Alyxian can't be {@status surprised} and can't be changed into another form against his will.

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If Alyxian fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Special Equipment.** Alyxian carries a magic dagger that he uses to make Stoneheart Dagger attacks. In the hands of creatures other than Alyxian, the dagger is nonmagical and has no special properties.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Spear | +9 to hit | 1d6 + 4 damage) piercing | - |
| Stoneheart Dagger | +9 to hit | 3d4 + 4 damage) force | - |

**Multiattack.** Alyxian makes two Spear attacks.

**Spear.** {@atk mw,rw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}7 (1d6 + 4 damage) piercing damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4 damage) piercing damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 9 (2d8 damage) radiant damage.

**Stoneheart Dagger.** {@atk mw,rw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}11 (3d4 + 4 damage) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or become petrified condition as the dagger lodges itself in the target's body. While the dagger is lodged in the target, magic can't end the petrified condition condition on it and Alyxian can't make Stoneheart Dagger attacks. A creature within reach of the petrified condition target can use an action to try to remove the dagger, doing so with a successful DC 17 Saving Throw Strength check.

## Legendary Actions

**Attack.** Alyxian makes one Spear or Stoneheart Dagger attack.

**Warrior's Stride.** Alyxian moves up to his speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

**Ruidium Shard (Costs 2 Actions).** A gem-sized shard of ruidium appears at a point Alyxian can see within 120 feet of himself and explodes. Each creature, other than Alyxian, in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion condition. If a creature isn't suffering from ruidium corruption, it becomes corrupted when it fails the saving throw.


## Reactions

**Parry.** Alyxian adds 3 to his AC against one attack roll that would hit him. To do so, Alyxian must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
