**Stomp.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 (2d12 + 3 damage) force damage.

**Realize Nightmares {@recharge 4}.** The oneirovore manipulates the perception of nearby creatures, sending them into a panic. Creatures of the oneirovore's choice that it can see within 60 feet must make a DC 19 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the charmed condition condition, their vision distorted such that they view their allies as creatures of pure fear and hatred. While charmed condition, a creature will use their actions to attack their allies with intent to kill. A charmed condition creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each turn, ending the effect on a success.

**Warning Cry (1/Day).** The oneirovore lets out an earsplitting shriek, calling for infernal reinforcements. Creatures that are not Fiends that are within 120 feet of the oneirovore must make a DC 19 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 55 (10d10 damage) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any lesser devils within a 1-mile-radius, centered on the oneirovore, are required by contract to come to its aid upon hearing its Warning Cry. Higher ranking devils may investigate if they desire, but the call holds no magical sway over them.
