**Multiattack.** The dragon turtle makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. It can make one tail attack in place of its two claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +13 to hit to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}26 (3d12 + 7 damage) piercing damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +13 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 (2d8 + 7 damage) slashing damage.

**Tail.** {@atk mw} +13 to hit to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}26 (3d12 + 7 damage) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the dragon turtle and knocked prone condition.

**Steam Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon turtle exhales scalding steam in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6 damage) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.
