**Multiattack.** Ulder makes three melee attacks, only one of which can be with his shield.

**+1 Longsword.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d8 + 4 damage) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10 + 4 damage) slashing damage when used with two hands.

**Shield.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}6 (1d6 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage, and Ulder pushes the target 5 feet away from him. Ulder then enters the space vacated by the target. If the target is pushed to within 5 feet of a creature friendly to Ulder, the target provokes an opportunity attack from that creature.

## Reactions

**Guardian Strike.** If an enemy within 5 feet of Ulder attacks a target other than him, Ulder can make a melee attack against that enemy.
