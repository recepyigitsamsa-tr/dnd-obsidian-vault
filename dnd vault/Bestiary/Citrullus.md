**False Appearance.** While the citrullus remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal melon plant.

**Gush.** When the citrullus takes bludgeoning damage, sticky juice splashes out of it.

**Bile Spray {@recharge 5}.** The citrullus exhales pink bile in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 14 (4d6 damage) acid damage and is restrained condition by the sticky seed-filled juice for 1 minute. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't restrained condition. A creature, including the restrained condition creature, can take its action to free the restrained condition creature by succeeding on a DC 13 Saving Throw Strength check.
