**Illusory Reality.** When Tyreus casts an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, he can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. He can do this on his turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing.

The object remains real for 1 minute. The object can't deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.

**Displacement (Recharges after Tyreus Casts an Illusion Spell of 1st Level or Higher).** As a bonus action, Tyreus projects an illusion that makes him appear to be standing a few inches from his actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against Tyreus. The effect ends if Tyreus takes damage, he is incapacitated condition, or his speed becomes 0.
