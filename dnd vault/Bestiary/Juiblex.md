**Eject Slime {@recharge 5}.** Juiblex spews out a corrosive slime, targeting one creature that it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 21 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw.

Unless the target avoids taking any of this damage, any metal armor worn by the target takes a permanent −1 penalty to the AC it offers, and any metal weapon it is carrying or wearing takes a permanent −1 penalty to damage rolls. The penalty worsens each time a target is subjected to this effect. If the penalty on an object drops to −5, the object is destroyed.
