If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet directly away from the professor and become restrained condition until the start of professor's next turn.

**Force Barrier {@recharge 5}.** The professor magically creates a wall of translucent, golden force within 90 feet of itself. The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the professor uses this action again. The barrier can be a vertical or horizontal plane up to 30 feet on a side or a 10-foot-radius hemispherical dome with a floor. The wall provides {@quickref Cover||3||total cover}.

## Reactions

**Arcane Stasis (2/Day).** When a creature the professor can see within 60 feet of it casts a spell, the professor can magically lock the casting in the moment before completion. The spellcaster must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw saving throw using the spell's spellcasting ability, or the spell fails and is wasted.
