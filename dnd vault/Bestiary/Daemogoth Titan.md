## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the titan fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Pact of Suffering.** Using a 10-minute long ritual, the titan can forge a magical bond with a willing creature it touches throughout the ritual. The creature becomes bound by the pact until it dies, the titan dies, or the pact is broken by a wish spell spell.

The titan chooses one spell from the {@filter necromancy or enchantment school that is 8th level or lower|spells|level=0;1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8|school=N;E}. The bound creature can cast that spell using this pact, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability. When it casts the spell, the creature takes 21 (6d6 damage) psychic damage, which can't break the creature's {@status concentration} on a spell. Once the bound creature casts the spell in this way, it can't do so again until it finishes a long rest.
