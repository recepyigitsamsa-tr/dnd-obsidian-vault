|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Swirling Bones | +10 to hit | 8d8 | - |

**Multiattack.** The bone swarm makes two Swirling Bones attacks. It can replace one Swirling Bones attack with one Death's Embrace attack, if available.

**Swirling Bones.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. {@h}36 (8d8 damage) bludgeoning, 36 (8d8 damage) piercing, or 36 (8d8 damage) slashing damage (the bone swarm's choice), or 18 (4d8 damage) bludgeoning, 8 (4d8 damage) piercing, or 8 (4d8 damage) slashing damage (the bone swarm's choice) if the swarm has half of its hp or fewer.

**Death's Embrace {@recharge 5}.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. {@h}The target is grappled condition (escape DC 16 Saving Throw) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the creature is restrained condition and any attack against the bone swarm has a 50 percent chance of hitting the grappled condition creature instead. The bone swarm can have only one creature grappled condition at a time. The grappled condition creature has advantage on ability checks made to escape the grapple when the bone swarm has half of its hp or fewer.
