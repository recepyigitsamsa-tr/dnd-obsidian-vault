## Traits

**Mimicry.** The strife can mimic Humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 17 Saving Throw Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check.

**Delight.** When a creature within 30 feet of the strife takes psychic damage, the strife gains 5 temporary hp or gains advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn (the strife's choice).


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Claw | +7 to hit | 1d6 + 5 damage) slashing | - |
| Sow Discord | DC 13 | 2d6 damage) psychic | - |
| Invisibility | - | - | - |

**Multiattack.** The strife can use its Sow Discord. It then makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft. one target. {@h}8 (1d6 + 5 damage) slashing damage.

**Sow Discord.** The strife attempts to sow discord in up to two creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 7 (2d6 damage) psychic damage and distrusts its allies until the start of the strife's next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn't distrust its allies. A creature that distrusts its allies can't give or receive aid from its allies, including spells, class features like Sneak Attack, and the Help action.

**Invisibility.** The strife magically turns invisible condition until it attacks or until its {@status concentration} ends (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). Any equipment the strife wears or carries is invisible condition with it.

## Reactions

**Induce Doubt.** If a creature misses the strife with an attack, the strife can cause the attacker to doubt itself. The attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or each time it makes an attack roll or saving throw before the end of its next turn, it must roll a {@dice d4} and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.
