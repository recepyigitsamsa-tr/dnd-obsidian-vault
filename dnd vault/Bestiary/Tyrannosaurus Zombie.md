## Traits

**Disgorge Zombie.** As a bonus action, the tyrannosaurus zombie can disgorge a normal zombie, which appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. The disgorged zombie acts on its own initiative count. After a zombie is disgorged, roll a {@dice d6}. On a roll of 1, the tyrannosaurus zombie runs out of zombies to disgorge and loses this trait. If the tyrannosaurus zombie still has this trait when it dies, {@dice 1d4} normal zombies erupt from its corpse at the start of its next turn. These zombies act on their own initiative count.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the tyrannosaurus zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.
