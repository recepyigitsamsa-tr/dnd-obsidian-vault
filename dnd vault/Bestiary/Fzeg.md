## Traits

**Keen Hearing and Smell.** The fzeg has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the fzeg fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Rampage.** When the fzeg reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the fzeg can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.

**Regeneration.** The fzeg regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. If the fzeg takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the fzeg's next turn.

**Shapechanger.** The fzeg can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid or back into its true form, that of a wolfhumanoid hybrid. It can transform its body parts as part of attacking with them and can choose whether the change remains after making the attack. Other than its size, its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it's wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Spider Climb.** The fzeg can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
