**Multiattack.** The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled condition by the vampire, incapacitated condition, or restrained condition. {@h}7 (1d6 + 4 damage) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

**Unarmed Strike.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d8 + 4 damage) bludgeoning damage. The vampire can also grapple the target (escape DC 13 Saving Throw) if it is a creature and the vampire has a hand free.

**Mind Siphon {@recharge 5}.** The vampire targets a creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Intelligence saving throw, with disadvantage if the vampire has previously consumed the target's blood. On a failed save, the target takes 28 (8d6 damage) psychic damage, and the vampire discerns the target's surface emotions and thoughts. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the vampire discerns the target's general emotional state but not its thoughts.
