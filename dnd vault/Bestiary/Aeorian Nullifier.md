## Traits

**Horrid Gnashing.** The nullifier's mouths gnash incoherently while it can see any enemies. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the nullifier and can hear it must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature rolls a {@dice d8} to determine what it does during the current turn:

**Magic Resistance.** The nullifier has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

| Bites | +8 to hit | 2d12 + 4 damage) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10 damage) force | - |

**Multiattack.** The nullifier makes three attacks: one with its bites and two with its claws.

**Bites.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}17 (2d12 + 4 damage) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10 damage) force damage.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}11 (2d6 + 4 damage) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10 damage) force damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 16 Saving Throw) if it's a creature. The nullifier has two claws, each of which can grapple one creature.

## Reactions

**Counterspell.** The nullifier attempts to interrupt a creature that it can see within 60 feet in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, the nullifier makes a Charisma check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.
