## Traits

**Adaptive Hide.** After taking damage, the chapped brute abomination gains resistance to that type of damage until it takes another type of damage.

**Keen Hearing and Smell.** The chapped brute abomination has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on hearing or smell. While deafened condition and unable to smell, the brute can't use its blindsight.

**Unstable Life.** At the start of the chapped brute abomination's turn, roll {@dice 1d20}. The abomination regains hit points equal to any even result and loses hit points equal to any odd result. The abomination can neither exceed its hit point maximum with a gain nor fall below 1 hit point with a loss.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Tentacle | +10 to hit | 3d10 + 6 damage) bludgeoning | - |
| Engulf | DC 18 | 4d6 damage) acid | - |

**Multiattack.** The chapped brute abomination makes two tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}22 (3d10 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled condition (escape DC 18 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition, and the brute can't use the tentacle against another target. The chapped brute abomination has four tentacles.

**Engulf.** Each creature grappled condition by the chapped brute abomination must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be pulled into the brute's body. An engulfed target is blinded condition, restrained condition, unable to breathe, and has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} from effects that originate outside the brute. At the start of each of the brute's turns, each engulfed creature takes 14 (4d6 damage) acid damage. The brute can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.

An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make its choice of a DC 18 Saving Throw Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. On a success, the creature escapes and uses 10 feet of movement to enter a space of its choice within 5 feet of the brute.

If the brute dies, an engulfed creature is no longer restrained condition by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement.

If a creature dies inside the brute, the brute doesn't roll for Unstable Life at the start of its next turn and instead regains 20 hit points. The creature's body breaks up inside the brute, and the brute expels anything the creature wore or carried.
