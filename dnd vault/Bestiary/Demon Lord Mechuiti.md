## Traits

**Demon Lord's Ichor.** When Mechuiti is subjected to piercing damage or slashing damage, a spray of caustic blood spurts from his hide. Each creature within 10 feet of Mechuiti must succeed on a DC 24 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or becoming infected with the Mechuiti's deadly ichor disease and be poisoned condition until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hp maximum by 14 ({@dice 4d6}) on a failure. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0. The disease can be cured by the greater restoration spell spell or similar magic or when the creature succeeds on three saving throws.

**Fiery Weapons.** Mechuiti's weapon attacks are magical. When Mechuiti hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 6d6 damage fire damage (included in the attack).

**Immolating Corona.** At the start of each of Mechuiti's turns, each creature within 10 feet of him takes 10 (3d6 damage) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 24 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or catch fire. A creature that touches Mechuiti or hits him with a melee attack while within 5 feet of him takes 10 (3d6 damage) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 24 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or catch fire. Until a creature uses an action to douse the fire, the creature on fire takes 7 (2d6 damage) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Magic Resistance.** Mechuiti has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
