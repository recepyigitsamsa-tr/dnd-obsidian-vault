**Brittle Spine.** For each Brittle Spine a creature has, the creature takes 3 (1d6 damage) poison damage at the start of each of their turns, and when Morax activates Burrow or Deep Burrow. Spines can only be removed by a Regeneration spell or similar, or by killing Morax.

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede Morax's darkvision.

**Magic Resistance.** Morax has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spined Hide.** Whenever Morax is hit with a melee attack, the attacker takes 7 (2d6 damage) piercing damage and gains 1 Brittle Spine.

**Unbreakable Bond.** If Morax is reduced to 0 hit points while Brother Adramalech still lives, Morax regenerates 50 hit points at the start of his next turn. This regeneration is interrupted if Brother Adramalech is reduced to 0 hit points before the start of Morax's turn.
