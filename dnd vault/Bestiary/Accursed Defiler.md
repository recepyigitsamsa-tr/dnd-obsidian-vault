## Traits

**Cursed Existence.** When it drops to 0 hp in desert terrain, the accursed defiler's body disintegrates into sand and a parched breeze. However, unless it was killed in a hallowed location, with radiant damage, or by a creature under the effects of the bless spell spell, the accursed defiler reforms at the next sundown {@dice 1d100} miles away from where it died in a random direction.

**Sand Shroud.** A miniature sandstorm constantly whirls around the accursed defiler in a 10-foot radius. This area is lightly obscured to creatures other than the accursed defiler. Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) checks made to follow tracks left by the accursed defiler or other creatures that were traveling in its sand shroud are made with disadvantage.

**Undead Nature.** The accursed defiler doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
