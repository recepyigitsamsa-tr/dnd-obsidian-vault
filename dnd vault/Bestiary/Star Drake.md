## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The drake has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Nimbus of Swirling Stars.** At the start of each of the drake's turns, each creature within 10 feet of it and that can see it must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated condition until the end of its next turn.

**Planar Weapons.** The drake's weapon attacks are magical. When it hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 damage force damage (included in the attack).

**Multiattack.** The drake makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or it makes four Searing Star attacks. If two Searing Star attacks hit one creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be blinded condition until the end of its next turn.

**Planar Traveler.** The star drake can transport itself to a different plane of existence. This works like the plane shift spell spell, except the drake can affect only itself and can't use this action to banish an unwilling creature to another plane.

**Plane-Altered Breath {@recharge 5}.** The drake exhales raw magic in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (10d10 damage) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
