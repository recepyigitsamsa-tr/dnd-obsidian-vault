**Multiattack.** The hag makes two Nightmare Touch attacks.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 (1d6 + 2 damage) slashing damage.

**Nightmare Touch.** {@atk ms} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}18 (4d6 + 4 damage) psychic damage. If the target is unconscious condition, it takes an extra 10 (3d6 damage) psychic damage and is cursed until the hag dies or the curse is removed. The cursed creature's hit point maximum decreases by 5 ({@dice 1d10}) whenever it finishes a long rest.

## Reactions

**Dream Eater.** When an unconscious condition creature the hag can see within 30 feet of her regains consciousness, the hag can force the creature to make a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature takes 11 (2d10 damage) psychic damage, and the hag regains hit points equal to the amount of damage taken.
