| Multiattack | - | - | - |

**Multiattack.** The cluster makes two Slam attacks. It can replace one of these attacks with Spawn Progeny if available.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}17 (2d10 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6 damage) psychic damage, and if the target is a creature, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or have the prone condition condition. If this attack reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target immediately dies and is consumed by the cluster.

**Spawn Progeny (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The cluster bulges and spews {@dice 1d4} mature eggs. Each egg lands in an unoccupied space of the cluster's choice within 30 feet of itself and immediately transforms into an encephalon gemmule|PaBTSO. The gemmules obey the cluster's commands and take their turns immediately after it.

## Reactions

**Aggressive Hunger.** Immediately after being hit by an attack, the cluster moves up to its speed toward the attacker. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. If the cluster ends this movement within 5 feet of the attacker, it then makes one Slam attack against that attacker.
