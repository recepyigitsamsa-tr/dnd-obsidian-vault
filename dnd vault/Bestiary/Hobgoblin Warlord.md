**Shield Bash.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}5 (1d4 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be knocked prone condition.

**Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the hobgoblin can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a {@dice d4} to its roll provided it can hear and understand the hobgoblin. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the hobgoblin is incapacitated condition.

## Reactions

**Parry.** The hobgoblin adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the hobgoblin must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
