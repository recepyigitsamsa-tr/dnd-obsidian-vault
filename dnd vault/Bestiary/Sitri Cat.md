## Traits

**Keen Smell.** The Sitri cat has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on smell.

**Seven Shades of Sitri.** A humanoid who touches a Sitri cat must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or become infected with the Seven Shades of Sitri. If a humanoid succeeds on the saving throw, they're immune to the disease for 24 hours. Carnal urges overwhelm an infected humanoid. When the infected interacts with another non-hostile humanoid, the infected becomes charmed condition by that humanoid until the subject of the infatuation or their friends harm the infected. The infected can repeat the saving throw once every 24 hours. Current infatuations end when one of these saves succeeds. The disease ends for the infected when they have succeeded on five saving throws.
