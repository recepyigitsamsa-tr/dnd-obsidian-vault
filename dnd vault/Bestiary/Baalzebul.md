**Lord of Flies.** Insects don't attack Baalzebul, and he can issue orders to them.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Baalzebul fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Baalzebul has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Stench of the Slug (Slug Form Only).** A creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of Baalzebul must succeed on a DC 21 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition condition until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature is immune to this stench for 1 hour.
