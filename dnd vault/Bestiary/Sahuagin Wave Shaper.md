**Multiattack.** The wave shaper makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 (2d8 + 1 damage) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8 damage) cold damage.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 (2d8 + 1 damage) slashing damage plus 13 (3d8 damage) cold damage.

**Whirlpool (1/Day).** The wave shaper targets a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep, causing a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, 25 feet tall, and lasts for 1 minute or until the wave shaper is incapacitated condition. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by succeeding on a DC 14 Saving Throw Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check.

When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 9 (2d8 damage) bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until it ends. On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but it has disadvantage on the Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to do so.

The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 9 (2d8 damage) bludgeoning damage. This damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.
