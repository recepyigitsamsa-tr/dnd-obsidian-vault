**Multiattack.** The nightmare haunt makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 (1d6 + 3 damage) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8 damage) psychic damage.

**Tendrils of Slumber {@recharge 5}.** The nightmare haunt creates spectral tendrils that cover the ground in a 20-foot square that it can see within 30 feet of itself for 1 minute or until it uses this action again. When a creature other than the nightmare haunt enters the affected area for the first time or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or take 11 (2d10 damage) necrotic damage and have the restrained condition condition. The affected ground is also considered difficult terrain for creatures other than the nightmare haunt for the duration of its effect.

A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained condition by the tendrils must repeat the saving throw. On a failed save, it has the unconscious condition condition and instead of the restrained condition condition caused by the tendrils. On a successful save, the effect ends on the creature. An unconscious condition creature remains asleep until it is no longer in the area with tendrils, takes any damage, or is targeted by a remove curse spell spell or similar magic.
