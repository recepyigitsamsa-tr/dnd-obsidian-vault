## Traits

**Enchanted Weapons.** The horseman's weapon attacks are magical. When the horseman hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d8 damage damage of a type depending on the horseman: cold (black night), fire (red sun), radiant (bright day).

**Magic Resistance.** The horseman has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Peerless Rider.** Any attacks directed at the horseman's mount target the horseman instead, and the horseman confers his damage resistances and immunities and his condition immunities to his mount. In addition, if the horseman and mount are subjected to an effect that allows each to make a saving throw to take only half damage, the mount takes no damage if the horseman succeeds on the saving throw.

**Timeless Nature.** The horseman doesn't age and doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
