**Multiattack.** The cactid makes two Tendril attacks and uses Reel.

**Tendril.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. {@h}10 (2d6 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6 damage) piercing damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 13 Saving Throw) if it is a Medium or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition, and if it isn't a Construct or Undead, the cactid begins draining fluid from the target's body. At the start of each of the grappled condition creature's turns, the creature must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its hp maximum is reduced by 3 ({@dice 1d6}). This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after drinking at least one gallon of water. The grappled condition creature dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. The cactid has two tendrils, each of which can grapple only one target.

**Reel.** The cactid pulls each creature grappled condition by it up to 10 feet straight toward it.

## Reactions

**Hail of Needles (1/Day).** When reduced to below half its hp maximum, the cactid releases a hail of needles. Each creature within 15 feet of the cactid must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6 damage) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
