## Actions

|--------|--------------|--------|----------|

**Multiattack.** The sand spider makes one Bite attack and two Impaling Leg attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}10 (1d10 + 5 damage) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6 damage) poison damage.

**Impaling Leg.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d6 + 5 damage) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be grappled condition (escape DC 16 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition and takes 7 (2d6 damage) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns, and the sand spider can't use the same Impaling Leg on another target. The sand spider has four Impaling Legs.

## Reactions

**Trapdoor Ambush.** When the sand spider is burrowed just below the surface of sand and a Medium or smaller creature enters the space on the surface just above where it is burrowed, the sand spider makes one Impaling Leg attack against the creature, bursting from the sand and revealing itself in the process. The target has disadvantage on the saving throw to avoid being grappled condition.
