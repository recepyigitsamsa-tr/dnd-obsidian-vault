For each creature that fails the saving throw, a gibbering mouther (see its entry in the Monster Manual) appears in an unoccupied space on a surface that can support it within 30 feet of that creature. The gibbering mouthers act right after the emissary on the same initiative count, gaining a +7 bonus to their attack and damage rolls, and fighting until they are destroyed. They disappear when the emissary dies.

The area becomes {@quickref difficult terrain||3} for the duration. Any creature takes 10 (3d6 damage) piercing damage for each 5 feet it moves on this terrain.

Each creature within 30 feet of the emissary must succeed on a DC 23 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or take 32 (5d12 damage) psychic damage.
