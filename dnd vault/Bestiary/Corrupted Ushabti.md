## Traits

**Necrotic Weapons.** The ushabti's weapon attacks are magical. When the ushabti hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra (2d6 damage) necrotic damage (included in the attack).

**Regeneration.** The ushabti regains 5 hp at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hp.

**Swarm Body.** The corrupted ushabti is a spirit inhabiting a colony of scarabs around a Humanoid skeleton within funerary wrappings. It can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny scarab and Humanoid bones, and it can't regain hp or gain temporary hp, except for its Regeneration trait. In addition, a creature that hits the ushabti with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2 (1d4 damage) piercing damage as a dozen Tiny scarabs skitter out and bite the attacker.

**Undead Nature.** The ushabti doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
