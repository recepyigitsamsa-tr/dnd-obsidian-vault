## Traits

**Antimagic Gullet.** Magical effects, including those produced by spells and magic items but excluding those created by artifacts or deities, are suppressed inside the eye monger's gullet. Any spell slot or charge expended by a creature in the gullet to cast a spell or activate a property of a magic item is wasted. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. No spell or magical effect that originates outside the eye monger's gullet, except one created by an artifact or a deity, can affect a creature or an object inside the gullet.

**False Appearance.** If the eye monger is motionless and has its eye and mouth closed at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the eye monger move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to discern that the eye monger is animate.

**Unusual Nature.** The eye monger doesn't require air.
