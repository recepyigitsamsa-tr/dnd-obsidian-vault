## Traits

**Amphibious.** The glass gator can breathe air and water.

**Constricting Lunge.** If the glass gator jumps at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a Claw attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be knocked prone condition. If the target is prone condition, the gator can make one Constrict attack against it as a bonus action.

**Standing Leap.** The glass gator's long jump is up to 15 feet and its high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.

| Constrict | +4 to hit | 1d6 + 2 damage) bludgeoning | - |

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 (2d6 + 2 damage) slashing damage.

**Constrict.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}5 (1d6 + 2 damage) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 12 Saving Throw). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained condition and takes 5 (2d4 damage) poison damage at the start of each of its turns, and the glass gator can't use Constrict on another target.

## Reactions

**Silt Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** When it takes damage while underwater and within 5 feet of the bottom of a body of water, the glass gator stirs up a 10-foot-radius sphere of silt centered on it. The silt spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong current disperses it. The glass gator can then swim up to half its speed. The cloud of silt doesn't move with the glass gator.
