The nightgarm can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If the nightgarm takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the nightgarm must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone condition in a space within 5 feet of the nightgarm.

The wolves remain for 1 hour, until the nightgarm dies, or until the nightgarm dismisses them as a bonus action.
