The cage disintegrates if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour.

**Soul Exchange {@recharge}.** The savant exchanges its soul with one Humanoid it can see within 20 feet of it. Its body becomes paralyzed condition, the target's soul inhabits the savant's paralyzed condition body, and the savant inhabits the target's body, taking full control of it. The savant retains its alignment, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, its Psychic Burst action, and its immunity to being charmed condition and frightened condition. It otherwise uses the target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The exchange lasts until the target's body or the savant's body is reduced to 0 hp, the savant ends it as a bonus action, or the savant is forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell spell. When the exchange ends, the target returns to its body, regaining control, and the savant's soul returns to its body, which is no longer paralyzed condition. The target is immune to this savant's Soul Exchange for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the exchange ends.
