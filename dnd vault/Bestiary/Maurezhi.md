**Multiattack.** The maurezhi makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}14 (2d10 + 3 damage) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, its Charisma score is reduced by {@dice 1d4}. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if this reduces its Charisma to 0. It rises 24 hours later as a ghoul, unless it has been revived or its corpse has been destroyed.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d8 + 3 damage) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed condition for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Raise Ghoul {@recharge 5}.** The maurezhi targets one dead ghoul or ghast it can see within 30 feet of it. The target is revived with all its hit points.
