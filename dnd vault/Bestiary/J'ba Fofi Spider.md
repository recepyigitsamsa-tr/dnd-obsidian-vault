## Traits

**Camouflaged Webs.** With 10 minutes of work, the j'ba fofi can create a camouflaged web in a 10-foot cube. The web must be anchored between two solid mases or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling. A camouflaged web layered over a flat surface has a depth of 5 feet. The web is camouflaged to match its surroundings, requiring a successful DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to notice them. Each creature that starts its turn in the camouflaged web or that enters it during the creature's turn must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or be restrained condition. A creature, including the restrained condition creature, can take its action to break the webbing and free the restrained condition creature by succeeding on a DC 13 Saving Throw Strength check. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).

**Forest Camouflage.** The j'ba fofi has advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks made to hide in forested terrain.

**Spider Climb.** The j'ba fofi can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Spider Passivism.** No spider can willingly attack the j'ba fofi, unless attacked first. A spider can be forced to do so through magical means.

**Web Sense.** While in contact with a web, the j'ba fofi knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

**Web Walker.** The j'ba fofi ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.
