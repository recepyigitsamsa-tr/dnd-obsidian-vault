**Multiattack.** The mind flayer makes two Tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}21 (3d10 + 5 damage) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it has the grappled condition condition (escape DC 17 Saving Throw) and must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Intelligence saving throw or have the incapacitated condition condition until the grapple ends.

**Extract Brain.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one incapacitated condition Humanoid grappled condition by the mind flayer. {@h}55 (10d10 damage) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the mind flayer kills it by extracting and devouring its brain.

**Unleash Void {@recharge 5}.** The mind flayer opens a rift into the Far Realm, centered on a point the mind flayer can see within 60 feet of itself, and a tentacle lashes across creatures near the rift. Each creature other than mind flayers within 30 feet of the rift must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Intelligence saving throw, after which the tentacle disappears and the rift closes. On a failed save, a creature takes 18 (4d8 damage) cold damage from the rift plus 18 (4d8 damage) psychic damage from the tentacle and has the stunned condition condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A stunned condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Reactions

**Warp Reality.** When hit by an attack roll, the mind flayer gains a +4 bonus to its AC against that attack roll, potentially causing it to miss. Then the mind flayer, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, magically teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
