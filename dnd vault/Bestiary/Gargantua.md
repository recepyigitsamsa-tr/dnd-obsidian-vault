## Traits

**Weird Aura.** At the start of each of the gargantua's turns, each creature of the gargantua's choice within 30 feet of it must make a DC 19 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target sees the gargantua as a manifestation of the target's worst fears; it takes 17 (5d6 damage) psychic damage and has the frightened condition condition until the start of the target's next turn. On a successful save, a target is immune to this gargantua's Weird Aura for 24 hours.

**Rock.** {@atk rw} +15 to hit to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. {@h}24 (3d10 + 8 damage) bludgeoning damage.

## Reactions

**Flick.** Immediately after the gargantua takes damage from a Large or smaller creature it can see within 20 feet of itself, it attempts to flick the creature away. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Saving Throw Strength saving throw, or the target takes 18 (3d6 + 8 damage) bludgeoning damage, is pushed horizontally up to 100 feet away from the gargantua, and has the prone condition condition.

**Spell Mimicry (1/Day).** Immediately after a creature the gargantua can see casts a spell of 5th level or lower, the gargantua tries to copy the spell. That creature must succeed on a DC 19 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw, or the gargantua immediately casts the same spell at the same level (+11 to hit to hit with spell attacks, spell save DC 19 Saving Throw), requiring no material components and choosing the spell's targets.
