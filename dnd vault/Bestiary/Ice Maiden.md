**Multiattack.** The ice maiden makes two Ice Blade or Ice Bolt attacks.

**Ice Blade.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 (1d8 + 3 damage) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6 damage) cold damage.

**Ice Bolt.** {@atk rs} +8 to hit to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}19 (4d6 + 5 damage) cold damage.

**Kiss of the Frozen Heart.** The ice maiden kisses a willing Humanoid, freezing the target's heart. The target has immunity to cold damage, but it is charmed condition by the ice maiden until the maiden ends the effect (no action required) or until the target is kissed by a creature that loves it. The charmed condition target obeys the maiden's verbal commands. If the target suffers any harm from the maiden or her allies, or if it receives a suicidal command, it can make a DC 16 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. The maiden can have no more than three Humanoids charmed condition at a time.

**Icy Embrace {@recharge 5}.** The ice maiden blasts wintry weather on a point she can see within 60 feet of her. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 28 (8d6 damage) cold damage and is restrained condition by ice until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't restrained condition. The area then becomes icy, difficult terrain for 1 minute.
