**Acid Splash (Cantrip).** The simulacrum hurls a bubble of acid at one creature it can see within 60 feet of it, or at two such creatures that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6 damage) acid damage.

**Magic Missile (1st-Level Spell; Requires a Spell Slot).** The simulacrum creates three darts of magical force. Each dart unerringly strikes one creature the simulacrum can see within 120 feet of it, dealing 3 (1d4 + 1 damage) force damage. If the simulacrum casts this spell using a 2nd-level spell slot, it creates one more dart.
