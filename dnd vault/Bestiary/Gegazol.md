**Magic Resistance.** Gegazol has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Rejuvenation.** If destroyed while her soul vessel remains intact, Gegazol's unconscious condition body rejuvenates within 5 feet of the soul vessel, where she regains 78 ({@dice 12d12}) hit points each day. When she has regained half her hit points, she regains consciousness.

**Stench.** Any creature not immune to the poisoned condition condition that starts its turn within 30 feet of Gegazol must succeed on a DC 23 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or become poisoned condition until the start of that creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to Gegazol's stench for 1 hour.

**Turning Defiance.** Gegazol and undead within 120 feet of her have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.
