## Traits

**False Appearance (Object Form Only).** While the mimic remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary object.

**Life Path.** Regardless of the form it takes, the map mimic can make a map on its surface (no action required) that shows the route it has traveled since it left its parent mimic. The map shows terrain features and landmarks of where it has been, but doesn't show the names of those places.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Pseudopod | +4 to hit | 1d6 + 2 damage) bludgeoning | - |

**Pseudopod.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 (1d6 + 2 damage) bludgeoning damage, and it attaches to the target. While attached, the mimic can't attack, the target is blinded condition, and at the start of each of the mimic's turns, the target takes 5 (1d6 + 2 damage) bludgeoning damage.

The attached mimic moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the mimic's movement. It can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the mimic by succeeding on a DC 8 Saving Throw Strength check.
