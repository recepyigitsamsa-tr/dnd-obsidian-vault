## Traits

**Aura of Silence.** When a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the ashen rider, the rider can force that creature to make a DC 18 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw if the rider can see it. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this aura for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature can't speak and is deafened condition until the start of its next turn.

**Mount.** If the ashen rider isn't mounted, it can use a bonus action to magically teleport onto the creature serving as its mount, provided the ashen rider and its mount are on the same plane of existence. When it teleports, the ashen rider appears astride the mount along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying.

While mounted and not incapacitated condition, the ashen rider can't be {@status surprised}, and both it and its mount have advantage on Dexterity saving throws. If the ashen rider is reduced to 0 hit points while riding its mount, the mount is reduced to 0 hit points as well.
