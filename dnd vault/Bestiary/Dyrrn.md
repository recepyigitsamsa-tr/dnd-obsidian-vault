## Traits

**Alien Mind.** If a creature tries to read Dyrrn's thoughts or deals psychic damage to it, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 Saving Throw Intelligence saving throw or be stunned condition for 1 minute. The stunned condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Dyrrn fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Dyrrn has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Regeneration.** Dyrrn regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn. If Dyrrn takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn. Dyrrn dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Teleport.** As a bonus action, Dyrrn can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

**Multiattack.** Dyrrn makes one Tentacle Whip attack and uses its Corruption once. Dyrrn can replace its Tentacle Whip attack with Extract Brain if it has a creature grappled condition.

**Tentacle Whip.** {@atk mw} +15 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}24 (3d10 + 8 damage) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled condition (escape DC 23 Saving Throw), pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of Dyrrn, and must succeed on a DC 23 Saving Throw Intelligence saving throw or be stunned condition until this grapple ends. Dyrrn can't use the same tentacle whip on another target until this grapple ends. Dyrrn has two tentacle whips.

**Corruption.** Dyrrn targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 22 (4d6 + 8 damage) necrotic damage and become corrupted for 1 minute.

A corrupted creature's flesh twists in alien ways. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, its speed is reduced by half, and if it tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Intelligence check or the spell fails and is wasted. The corrupted creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Extract Brain.** {@atk mw} +15 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one incapacitated condition creature grappled condition by Dyrrn. {@h}55 (10d10 damage) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, Dyrrn kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.

Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 23 Saving Throw Intelligence saving throw or take 30 (5d8 + 8 damage) psychic damage and be stunned condition for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
