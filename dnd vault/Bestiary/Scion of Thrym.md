**Multiattack.** The scion makes one Ice Axe and two Slam attacks, or it makes two Glacier Throw attacks.

**Ice Axe.** {@atk mw} +17 to hit to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. {@h}36 (4d12 + 10 damage) force damage plus 18 (4d8 damage) cold damage.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +17 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}32 (4d10 + 10 damage) force damage.

**Glacier Throw.** {@atk rw} +17 to hit to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. {@h}36 (4d12 + 10 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6 damage) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 25 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or have the prone condition condition.

**Glacial Upheaval {@recharge 5}.** The scion digs its hands into the ground at a point it can see within 30 feet of itself and launches a magically conjured mass of ice into the air. Each creature other than the scion in a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must make a DC 25 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 36 (8d8 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 19 (3d12 damage) cold damage and is pushed vertically to the top of the cylinder, at which point the creature falls. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside the cylinder with no additional effects.

At the start of the scion's next turn, a mass of ice plummets to the ground on a point the scion can see within 60 feet of the point the scion dug its hands into. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must succeed on a DC 25 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8 damage) cold damage.
