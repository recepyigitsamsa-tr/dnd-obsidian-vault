**Multiattack.** Malaxxix makes two Forge Hammer or Whip attacks in any combination.

**Forge Hammer.** {@atk mw,rw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft. or range 60/180 ft., one target. {@h}28 (4d10 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage, and the target can't take reactions until the end of Malaxxix's next turn. {@hom}The hammer then magically returns to Malaxxix's hand.

**Whip.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 30 ft., one creature. {@h}15 (2d8 + 6 damage) slashing damage, and the target has the restrained condition condition for 1 minute. The restrained condition target can make a DC 20 Saving Throw Strength saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Only one creature can be restrained condition by the whip at a time.

**Mezzoloth Vortex {@recharge 5}.** Malaxxix summons a vortex of whirling mezzoloths at a point it can see within 90 feet of itself. The vortex is a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Each creature other than Malaxxix in that area must make a DC 20 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 35 (10d6 damage) force damage and has the restrained condition condition while within the cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside the cylinder. The vortex lasts until the start of Malaxxix's next turn.

## Legendary Actions

**Fiendish Stride.** Malaxxix moves up to its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. When Malaxxix moves within 5 feet of a creature during this movement, that creature takes 5 (1d10 damage) lightning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

**Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** Malaxxix makes one Forge Hammer or Whip attack.
