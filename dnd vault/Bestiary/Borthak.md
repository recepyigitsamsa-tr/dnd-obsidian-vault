## Traits

**Glacial Aura.** At the end of the borthak's turn, slippery ice covers surfaces within 10 feet of the borthak. This ice is difficult terrain. When a creature other than the borthak enters the ice's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or have the prone condition condition. The ice disappears at the start of the borthak's next turn.

**Webbed Feet.** The borthak can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.
