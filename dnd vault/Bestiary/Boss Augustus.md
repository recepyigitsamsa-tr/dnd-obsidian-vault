**Multiattack.** Augustus makes any combination of two Bite, Claw, or Magic Longsword attacks.

**Bite (Wolf or Hybrid Form Only).** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}26 (5d8 + 4 damage) piercing damage. If the target is a Humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be cursed with lycanthropy. While cursed in this way, the target retains its alignment, languages, and equipment but otherwise uses the werewolf stat block, excluding actions that require equipment the target doesn't have. During any night when there's a full moon in the sky, the target becomes an NPC under the DM's control and remains so until the night ends. A Remove Curse spell spell or similar magic ends this curse.

**Claw (Wolf or Hybrid Form Only).** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}21 (5d6 + 4 damage) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or have the prone condition condition.

**Magic Longsword (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}28 (4d10 + 6 damage) slashing damage.
