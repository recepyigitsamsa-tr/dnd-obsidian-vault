**Stomp.** {@atk mw} +14 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}29 (4d10 + 7 damage) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 22 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or have the prone condition condition. Until the colossus uses its Stomp again or moves, the creature has the restrained condition condition. The restrained condition creature or another creature within 5 feet of it can use its action to make a DC 22 Saving Throw Strength check. On a successful check, the affected creature relocates to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the colossus and is no longer restrained condition.

**Arcane Beam {@recharge 5}.** The colossus fires a beam of magical force from its chest, hands, or head in a 150-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 58 (9d12 damage) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
