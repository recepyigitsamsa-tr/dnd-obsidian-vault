**Multiattack.** The aurumvorax makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 (1d8 + 2 damage) piercing damage. If the target is a creature wearing armor of any type, the aurumvorax regains 4 ({@dice 1d6 + 1}) hit points.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 (1d6 + 2 damage) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled condition (escape DC 12 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the aurumvorax can't use its Claw attack on another target, and when it moves, it can drag the grappled condition creature with it, without the aurumvorax's speed being halved.
