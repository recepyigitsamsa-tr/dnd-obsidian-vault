## Traits

**Alert.** The giant can't be surprised, and it has advantage on initiative rolls.

**Amphibious.** The giant can breathe air and water.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the giant fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Scrying (Requires Storm Rune).** The giant can use its crystal ball to cast the scrying spell spell (save DC 17 Saving Throw).

**Storm Rune.** The giant has a storm rune inscribed on a crystal ball. While the object bearing the rune is embedded in its body, the giant can use its Tempest Call action and its Scrying trait.

The object bearing the storm rune has AC 17; 50 hit points; and immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The object regains all its hit points at the end of every turn, but it turns to dust if reduced to 0 hit points or when the giant dies. If the rune is destroyed, the giant can inscribe a storm rune on another crystal ball in its possession when it finishes a short or long rest.
