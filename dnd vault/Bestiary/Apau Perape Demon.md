## Traits

**Diseased Ichor.** When the apau perape takes piercing damage or slashing damage, a spray of caustic blood spurts from the wound. Each creature within 5 feet of the apau perape must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or become infected with the Mechuiti's ichor disease and be poisoned condition until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hp maximum by 5 ({@dice 2d4}) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0.

**Magic Resistance.** The apau perape has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
