**Multiattack.** The sarcophagus slime can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes two Slam attacks. It can replace one Slam attack with a use of Corrupting Gaze.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 (2d6 + 2 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8 damage) acid damage.

**Corrupting Gaze.** One creature the sarcophagus slime can see within 30 feet of it must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8 damage) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. A Humanoid slain by this effect rises 24 hours later as a sarcophagus slime, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the sarcophagus slime's choice that is within 60 feet of the sarcophagus slime and aware of it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or become frightened condition for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the sarcophagus slime's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
