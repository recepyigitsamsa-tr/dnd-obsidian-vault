**Multiattack.** The colossus makes three attacks—one with its slam and two with its eldritch turrets—and then uses Stomp.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +18 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}29 (3d12 + 10 damage) bludgeoning damage, and the colossus can push the target up to 20 feet away from it.

**Eldritch Turret.** {@atk rs} +18 to hit to hit, range 300 ft., one target. {@h}18 (4d8 damage) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is knocked prone condition.

**Stomp.** The colossus stomps one of its feet at a point on the ground within 20 feet of it. Any creature in a 20-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder centered on this point must succeed on a DC 26 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take 33 (6d10 damage) bludgeoning damage and fall prone condition. Until the colossus uses its Stomp again or moves, the creature is restrained condition. While restrained condition in this way, the creature (or another creature within 5 feet of it) can use its action to make a DC 26 Saving Throw Strength check. On a success, the creature relocates to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the colossus and is no longer restrained condition.

Structures, as well as nonmagical objects that are neither being worn nor carried, take the same amount of damage if they are in the cylinder (no save).

**Incinerating Beam {@recharge 5}.** The colossus fires a beam of light in a 150-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 26 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 60 (11d10 damage) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this beam is disintegrated, leaving behind anything it was wearing or carrying.
