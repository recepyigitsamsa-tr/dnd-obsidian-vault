## Traits

**Collective Mind.** The collective's individual bones are connected via a hive mind. It can telepathically communicate with any of its individual bones within 50 miles of it, and it can't be surprised. If the collective is reduced to half its hp or fewer, its Intelligence score is reduced to 1, it can't cast spells, it immediately changes to its shapeless form, and it can't take on a Humanoid form.

**Grasping Limbs (Humanoid Form Only).** The bone collective can wield weapons and hold, grasp, push, pull, or interact with objects that might otherwise require a Humanoid form to accomplish.

**Swarm (Shapeless Form Only).** The bone collective can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny bone.

**Undead Nature.** The bone collective doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Wyrmblood Venom.** When the bone collective hits a poisoned condition creature with a Bite or Piercing Bones attack, the target's Charisma score is reduced by {@dice 1d4}. The target is incapacitated condition if this reduces its Charisma to 0. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.
