**Warp Creature.** The sibriex targets up to three creatures it can see within 120 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 20 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this sibriex's Warp Creature. On a failed save, the target is poisoned condition, which causes it to also gain 1 level of exhaustion condition. While poisoned condition in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. Three successful saves against the poison end it, and ending the poison removes any levels of exhaustion condition caused by it. Each failed save causes the target to suffer another level of exhaustion condition. Once the target reaches 6 levels of exhaustion condition, it dies and instantly transforms into a living abyssal wretch|mtf under the sibriex's control. The transformation of the body can be undone only by a wish spell spell.
