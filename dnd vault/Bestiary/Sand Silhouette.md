**Engulf.** The sand silhouette engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled condition by it. The engulfed target is blinded condition and restrained condition, and it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the sand silhouette's turns or take 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage. If the sand silhouette moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The sand silhouette can have only one creature engulfed at a time.

**Haunted Haboob (3/Day).** The sand silhouette creates a storm of whirling sand and wailing souls around itself. The storm is a 10-foot radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder centered on the silhouette and moves with the silhouette for 1 minute, until it ends the storm as a bonus action, or until its {@status concentration} ends (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). The sandstorm's area is lightly obscured, and a creature that starts its turn in the sandstorm's area or enters it for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or take 3 (1d6 damage) necrotic damage and be frightened condition for 1 minute. An engulfed creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw. A frightened condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
