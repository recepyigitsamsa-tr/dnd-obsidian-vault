## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Claws | +3 to hit | 1d8 + 1 damage) slashing | - |
| Siphon | DC 11 | - | - |

**Claws.** {@atk mw} +3 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 (1d8 + 1 damage) slashing damage.

**Siphon.** The gremlin drains aether from an aether-powered device it can see within 5 feet of it. If the object isn't being worn or carried, the touch automatically drains aether. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw to keep it out of the gremlin's reach.

If the aether-powered device grants any bonus (to attack rolls, damage rolls, Armor Class, and so on), that bonus is reduced by 1. If the device has charges, it loses 1 charge. Otherwise, it stops functioning for 1 round. Left unhindered, a gremlin can completely destroy an aether-powered device.
