**Horrifying Visage.** Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be frightened condition for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages {@dice 1d4 Ã— 10} years.

When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.
