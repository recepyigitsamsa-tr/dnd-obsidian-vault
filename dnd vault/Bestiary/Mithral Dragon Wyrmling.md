## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Bite | +4 to hit | 1d10 + 2 damage) piercing | - |
| Shard Breath {@recharge 5} | DC 11 | 4d6 damage) slashing | - |

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 (1d10 + 2 damage) piercing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the dragon can attempt to end one magical effect of its choice of 2nd level or lower on the target. This effect works like the dispel magic spell spell, except the dragon must always make an ability check. Its ability check for this is +4.

**Shard Breath {@recharge 5}.** The mithral dragon spits metallic shards in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 11 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6 damage) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The area becomes difficult terrain until the start of the dragon's next turn, then the shards dissolve into wisps of silvery smoke.
