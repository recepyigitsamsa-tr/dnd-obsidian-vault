**Keen Smell.** The corpsejaw has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on smell.

**Pounce.** If the corpsejaw moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or fall prone condition.
