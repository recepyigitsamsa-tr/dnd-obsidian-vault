**Bite.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 (2d6 + 3 damage) piercing damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 13 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition, and the water leaper can't Bite another target.

**Stinger.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d8 + 3 damage) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be poisoned condition for 1 minute. While poisoned condition in this way, the creature takes 5 (2d4 damage) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A poisoned condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Swallow.** The water leaper makes a Bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded condition and restrained condition, it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside the water leaper, and it takes 7 (2d6 damage) acid damage at the start of each of the water leaper's turns. The water leaper can have only one creature swallowed at a time.

If the water leaper takes 15 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the leaper must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone condition in a space within 5 feet of the leaper. If the leaper dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained condition by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone condition.
