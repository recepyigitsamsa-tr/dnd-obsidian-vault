**Multiattack.** The bonepowder ghoul makes two Bite attacks. It can replace one Bite attack with a use of Gravedust or Spellcasting. If both Bite attacks hit the same creature, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed condition for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}18 (3d8 + 5 damage) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8 damage) necrotic damage, and the target's Strength score is reduced by {@dice 1d4}. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. If the target is a Humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or contract the darakhul fever disease.

**Gravedust.** The ghoul projects a 30-foot cone of grave dust. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8 damage) necrotic damage. If a creature is a Humanoid, it must also succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or contract the darakhul fever disease.

**Whirlwind (Dust Form Only; Recharge 5-6).** The ghoul creates a whirlwind of bones and teeth in a 20-foot cube originating from it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 55 (10d10 damage) slashing damage, and its Strength score is reduced by {@dice 1d6}. The creature dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and its Strength score isn't reduced.

## Reactions

**Coalesce.** When a bonepowder ghoul deals necrotic damage with Gravedust to at least one creature that isn't a Construct or Undead, it can magically transform from its dusty form into a coalesced form. Its statistics are the same in each form, except it can speak audibly only in its coalesced form. The coalesced form lasts for a number of minutes equal to the total necrotic damage it dealt with Gravedust to creatures that aren't Constructs or Undead or until the ghoul ends it as a bonus action.
