## Traits

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness does not impair the koralk's darkvision.

**Harvester Venom.** The koralk produces a potent poison that liquefies the innards of those affected by it. Every hour that elapses after a creature succumbs to this poison, it must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6 damage) poison damage, and its hp maximum is reduced by that amount. Creatures with resistance or immunity to poison or the poisoned condition condition can be affected by this poison. Such creatures have advantage on the saving throw. This potent poison remains within the creature's body until removed by the greater restoration spell spell or similar magic. If a creature dies while suffering from this poison, it rises as a lemure 1 hour later under the control of the nearest non-lemure devil within 1 mile.

**Magic Resistance.** The koralk has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Steadfast.** The koralk can't be frightened condition while it can see an ally within 30 feet of it.
