|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Bite | +8 to hit | 2d10 + 5 damage) piercing | - |

**Multiattack.** The lindwurm makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. It can replace its Bite attack with one Constrict attack.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 (2d10 + 5 damage) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or contract a disease and be poisoned condition until the disease is cured. At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature suffers one level of exhaustion condition and doesn't regain expended Hit Dice from the rest. On a success, the creature's exhaustion condition level decreases by one, and it regains expended Hit Dice as normal from the rest. If a successful saving throw reduces the diseased creature's level of exhaustion condition below 1, the creature recovers from the disease, ending it.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d6 + 5 damage) slashing damage.

**Constrict.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}14 (2d8 + 5 damage) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 15 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition, and the lindwurm can't Constrict another target.
