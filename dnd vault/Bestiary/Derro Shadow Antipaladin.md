**Infectious Insanity {@recharge 5}.** The shadow antipaladin magically assaults the minds of up to three creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6 damage) psychic damage and is incapacitated condition for 1 minute as its mind fills with thoughts of eldritch terrors and otherworldly entities. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't incapacitated condition. An incapacitated condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Reactions

**Parry.** The shadow antipaladin adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the antipaladin must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
