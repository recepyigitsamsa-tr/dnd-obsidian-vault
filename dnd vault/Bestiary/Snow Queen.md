**Ice Climb.** When climbing on ice, the Snow Queen has a climbing speed of 20 feet, and she can climb difficult surfaces made of ice and snow, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Icy Weapons.** The Snow Queen's weapon attacks are magical. When she hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 damage cold damage (included in the attack).

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the Snow Queen fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Snowsight.** The Snow Queen can see through areas obscured by snowfall, sleet, rain, and other wintry precipitation without penalty.

**Snow Walk.** The Snow Queen can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost her extra movement.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Claw | +9 to hit | 2d6 + 4 damage) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) cold | - |

**Multiattack.** The Snow Queen makes two Claw or Ice Bolt attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 (2d6 + 4 damage) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) cold damage.

**Ice Bolt.** {@atk rs} +10 to hit to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}13 (2d8 + 4 damage) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) cold damage. The target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.

**Cold Snap {@recharge 5}.** The Snow Queen causes the temperature around her to drop dramatically. Each creature without 30 feet of the Snow Queen must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 42 (12d6 damage) cold damage and suffers one level of exhaustion condition. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn't suffer exhaustion condition. A creature that is immune to cold damage doesn't suffer exhaustion condition, even if it fails the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is petrified condition in ice for 1 minute. A petrified condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A petrified condition creature that takes fire damage has advantage on the saving throw to end the effect.

## Legendary Actions

**Attack.** The Snow Queen makes a Claw or Ice Bolt attack.

**Move.** The Snow Queen moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Snowblind.** One creature the Snow Queen can see within 120 feet of her must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or be blinded condition by swirling snow until the end of its next turn.

**Wintry Swirl (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature within 15 feet of the Snow Queen must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or have vulnerability to cold damage until the end of its next turn. A creature with immunity to cold damage that fails this saving throw instead loses its immunity to cold damage but isn't vulnerable to it.
