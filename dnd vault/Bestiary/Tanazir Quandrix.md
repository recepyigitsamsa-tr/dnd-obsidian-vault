**Multiattack.** Tanazir makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +16 to hit to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}14 (1d10 + 9 damage) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) force damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +16 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 (2d6 + 9 damage) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it is addled by recursive thoughts, reducing its speed to 0 until the start of Tanazir's next turn.

**Diminution Breath {@recharge 5}.** Tanazir exhales a weakening equation in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 45 (13d6 damage) force damage and 45 (13d6 damage) psychic damage and is weakened until the start of Tanazir's next turn. While weakened, it has disadvantage on the following rolls that rely on Strength: attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't weakened.

**Teleport.** Tanazir teleports to an unoccupied space she can see within 100 feet of herself.

## Legendary Actions

**Claw.** Tanazir makes one Claw attack.

**Fold Space (Costs 2 Actions).** Tanazir uses Teleport, and each other creature within 20 feet of the space she left must succeed on a DC 24 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 30 feet closer to the center of that space and take 16 (3d10 damage) force damage.

**Fractal Refraction (Costs 3 Actions).** Tanazir magically summons {@dice 1d4} fractal mascot|SCC|fractal mascots in unoccupied spaces she can see within 120 feet of herself. The fractals obey her commands and take their turns immediately after hers. While any of these fractals remain, attack rolls made against Tanazir have disadvantage. A summoned fractal disappears after 1 minute, when it or Tanazir dies, or when she uses this action again.
