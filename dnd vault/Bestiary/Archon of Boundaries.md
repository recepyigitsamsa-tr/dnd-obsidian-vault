**Radiant Lance.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}12 (1d12 + 6 damage) piercing damage plus 28 (8d6 damage) radiant damage, and the target is marked until the start of the archon's next turn.

## Reactions

**Archon's Pursuit.** When a creature marked by the archon's Radiant Lance ends its turn within 120 feet of the archon, the archon teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 5 feet of the creature.

**Haunting Radiance.** Immediately after a creature within 120 feet of the archon forces it to make a saving throw, the archon responds with a burst of light. The creature must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or have the blinded condition condition until the end of the creature's next turn.

**Parry.** The archon adds 5 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it, provided it can see the attacker.
