## Traits

**Aura of Invulnerability.** An invisible condition aura forms a 10-foot-radius sphere around the hollyphant for as long as it lives. Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells. The hollyphant can use an action to suppress this trait until its {@status concentration} ends (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell).

**Magic Weapons.** The hollyphant's weapon attacks are magical.

**Trumpet (3/Day).** The hollyphant blows air through its trunk, creating a trumpet sound that can be heard out to a range of 600 feet. The trumpet also creates a 30-foot cone of energy that has one of the following effects, chosen by the hollyphant:

**Trumpet of Blasting.** Each creature in the cone must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 17 (5d6 damage) thunder damage and is deafened condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't deafened condition. Nonmagical objects in the cone that aren't being held or worn take 35 (10d6 damage) thunder damage.

**Trumpet of Sparkles.** Creatures in the cone must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d8 + 4 damage) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Evil creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw. Good creatures in the cone take no damage.
