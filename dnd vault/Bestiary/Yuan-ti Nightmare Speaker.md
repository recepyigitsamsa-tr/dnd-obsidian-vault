**Multiattack (Yuan-ti Form Only).** The yuan-ti makes one constrict attack and one scimitar attack.

**Constrict.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}10 (2d6 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 14 Saving Throw) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition, and the yuan-ti can't constrict another target.

**Scimitar (Yuan-ti Form Only).** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 (1d6 + 3 damage) slashing damage.

**Invoke Nightmare (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The yuan-ti taps into the nightmares of a creature it can see within 60 feet of it and creates an illusory, immobile manifestation of the creature's deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 11 (2d10 damage) psychic damage and is frightened condition of the manifestation, believing it to be real. The yuan-ti must concentrate to maintain the illusion (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell), which lasts for up to 1 minute and can't be harmed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the illusion on a success, or taking 11 (2d10 damage) psychic damage on a failure.
