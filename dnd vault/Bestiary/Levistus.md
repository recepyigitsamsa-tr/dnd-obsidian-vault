## Traits

**Armor of Ice.** Levistus is always entombed in ice. The ice provides 100 temporary hit points. While Levistus has these temporary hit points, he has vulnerability to fire damage. If Levistus starts his turn with no temporary hit points from the ice, he regains 100 temporary hit points.

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede Levistus's darkvision.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Levistus fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Levistus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Sub-zero.** Cold damage dealt by Levistus ignores resistances and immunities.
