Each target must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw or be irritated for 1 minute.

The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Reactions

**Desperate Lies.** When a creature the ratatosk can see targets it with an attack, the ratatosk tells a lie while pointing to another creature within 5 feet of it. The attacker must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or believe the lie and attack the other creature instead.
