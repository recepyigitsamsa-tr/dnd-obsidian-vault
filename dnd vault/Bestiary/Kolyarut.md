**Multiattack.** The kolyarut makes four Unerring Blade attacks.

**Unerring Blade.** {@atk mw} automatic hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}24 force damage plus one of the following effects (choose one or roll a {@dice d6}):

**Edict of Blades {@recharge 5}.** The kolyarut moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks and can make one Unerring Blade attack against each creature it moves past. Whenever it hits a creature with an Unerring Blade attack during this movement, each spell of 5th level or lower on the creature ends, and the creature has the incapacitated condition condition until the end of the kolyarut's next turn.

**Plane Shift (3/Day).** The kolyarut casts plane shift spell, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability. The kolyarut can cast the spell normally, or it can cast the spell on an unwilling creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. If it uses the latter option, the targeted creature must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw or be sent to a teleportation circle in the Hall of Concordance in Sigil.

## Reactions

**Parry.** The kolyarut adds 6 to its AC against one attack roll that would hit it. To do so, the kolyarut must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
