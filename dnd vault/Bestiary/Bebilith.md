**Multiattack.** The bebilith uses Poisoned Web (if available) and then makes one Bite attack and two Foreleg attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}16 (2d12 + 3 damage) piercing damage plus 21 (6d6 damage) poison damage. Any creature that drops to zero hit points because of this attack ignites, suffering 7 (2d6 damage) fire damage at the start of each of its turns until the creature's hit points are above zero.

**Foreleg.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}21 (4d8 + 3 damage) slashing damage.

**Poisoned Web {@recharge 5}.** {@atk rw} +10 to hit to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. {@h}51 (10d8 + 6 damage) poison damage, and the target has the restrained condition condition until free of the web. While restrained condition, the target takes 9 (2d8 damage) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The target may use an action to make a DC 17 Saving Throw Strength check and if successful they are freed from the webbing. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 12; 10 hit points; immunity to bludgeoning, fire, poison, and psychic damage). If an attack or spell doing fire damage is used on the webbing, the webbing ignites (but is otherwise unharmed). Any creature restrained condition by the webbing suffers an additional 7 (2d6 damage) fire damage at the start of each of its turn.

**Stalker's Darkness (3/Day).** The bebilith casts darkness spell.
