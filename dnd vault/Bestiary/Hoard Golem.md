**Multiattack.** The hoard golem makes two Slam attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}22 (3d10 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8 damage) force damage.

**Thieving Whirlwind {@recharge 5}.** The hoard golem partially disperses into a whirlwind of coins, gemstones, and other valuables then recoalesces. Each creature within 20 feet of the golem must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 44 (8d10 damage) bludgeoning damage and loses one object it is wearing or carrying. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn't lose an object. Each object the golem steals must weigh no more than 20 pounds and not be wrapped around or firmly attached to a creature. For example, the golem could steal a belt pouch full of coins or a creature's jewel-encrusted dagger, but it can't steal a creature's shirt or armor. The hoard golem steals objects of high value over those of minimal value. The stolen object becomes part of the golem's body and can't be retrieved until the golem dies.
