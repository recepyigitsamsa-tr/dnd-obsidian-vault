**Multiattack.** The medusa makes one Constrict attack, one Final Blade attack, and one Snake Hair attack. Alternatively, it makes two Wrathful Strike attacks.

**Constrict.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 (3d6 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the grappled condition condition (escape DC 20 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target has the restrained condition condition, and the medusa can't constrict another creature.

**Final Blade.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 (2d6 + 6 damage) slashing damage plus 21 (6d6 damage) force damage. If the target has at least one head and the medusa rolled a 20 on the attack roll, the target is decapitated and dies if it fails a DC 20 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw and can't survive without that head. A target is immune to this effect if it takes none of the damage, has legendary actions, or is Huge or larger. Such a creature takes an extra 28 (8d6 damage) force damage from the hit.

**Snake Hair.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 (1d10 + 6 damage) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10 damage) poison damage.

**Wrathful Strike.** {@atk rs} +12 to hit to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. {@h}22 (3d10 + 6 damage) radiant damage, and the target has the blinded condition condition until the end of its next turn.
