## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the hollow dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Reconstruction.** When the hollow dragon is reduced to 0 hit points, its body breaks into nine pieces: two arms, two legs, two wings, a tail, a torso, and a head. Each piece is a Large object with AC 19, 27 hit points, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. After {@dice 1d6} days, if all pieces are still within 6 miles of each other, they all teleport to the location of the head piece and merge with it, whereupon the hollow dragon regains all its hit points and becomes active again.
