## Traits

**Hungry Dead Nature.** The darakhul requires no air or sleep.

**Master of Disguise.** A darakhul in a prepared disguise has advantage on Charisma ({@skill Deception}) checks made to pass as a living creature. While using this ability, it loses its Stench.

**Stench.** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the darakhul must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be poisoned condition until the start of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the darakhul's Stench for the next 24 hours. A darakhul using this ability can't also benefit from Master of Disguise.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the darakhul has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on sight.

**Turning Defiance.** The darakhul and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn Undead.
