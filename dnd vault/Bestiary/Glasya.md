## Traits

**Charm Aura.** When a creature moves to be within 120 feet of Glasya, they must succeed on a DC 23 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or have the charmed condition condition, treating Glasya as an ally, until they leave the aura. A creature that succeeds the saving throw is immune to this effect for 1 hour. Whenever a charmed condition creature takes damage, they may repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

**Dominating Presence.** Glasya deals an additional 13 (2d12 damage) psychic damage when attacking a charmed condition creature, and her attacks don't break charms.

**Fiendish Regeneration.** Glasya regains 20 hit points at the start of her turn. If she takes radiant damage this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn. Glasya dies only if she starts her turn with 0 hit points and is unable to regenerate. If Glasya is killed, her body slowly regenerates, returning to life 9 ({@dice 2d8}) weeks later.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Glasya fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Glasya has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
