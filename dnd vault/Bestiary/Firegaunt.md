The firegaunt can cause the maul to erupt with crimson flames, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6 damage) fire damage and 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage. The maul can erupt with flames in this way only once per turn.

Until the burning creature or another creature that can reach it takes an action to extinguish the fire, the burning creature can't regain hit points and takes 5 (1d10 damage) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
