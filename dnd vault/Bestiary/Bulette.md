**Deadly Leap.** If the bulette jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone condition and take 14 (3d6 + 4 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4 damage) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked prone condition, and is pushed 5 feet out of the bulette's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls prone condition in the bulette's space.
