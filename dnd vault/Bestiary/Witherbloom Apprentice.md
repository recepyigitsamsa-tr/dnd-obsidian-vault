## Traits

**Regeneration.** The apprentice regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.

**Verdant Talisman.** At the end of a 10-minute ritual, the apprentice can touch one willing creature (including itself) and bestow upon it a small talisman imbued with magic. Upon receiving the talisman, the creature gains 10 temporary hit points, and it can add {@dice 1d6} to its initiative rolls while it wears the talisman. These benefits last for 1 hour or until the apprentice conducts another ritual to bestow another talisman. When the benefits expire, the talisman crumbles to dust.

| Briar Vine | +4 to hit | 1d10 + 2 damage) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8 damage) poison | - |

**Briar Vine.** {@atk ms} +4 to hit to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}7 (1d10 + 2 damage) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8 damage) poison damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, the apprentice can pull it up to 10 feet closer to itself.

## Reactions

**Wither Burst.** When the apprentice sees a creature within 30 feet of itself drop to 0 hit points, the apprentice channels the expended life essence and targets another creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or become poisoned condition for 1 minute. While poisoned condition in this way, the target takes 3 (1d6 damage) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
