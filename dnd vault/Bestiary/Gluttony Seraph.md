**Bite.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}24 (3d12 + 5 damage) piercing damage and 9 (2d8 damage) radiant damage.

**Tongue.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature. {@h}10 (2d4 + 5 damage) bludgeoning damage and 9 (2d8 damage) radiant damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 18 Saving Throw) and pulled to within 5 feet of the seraph. Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained condition, and the seraph can't use its tongue or bite on another target.

**Swallow.** The seraph makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it holds grappled condition. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the grapple ends, and the target is swallowed. While swallowed, a creature is blinded condition and restrained condition, has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against anything originating outside the seraph, and takes 18 (4d8 damage) acid damage and 9 (2d8 damage) radiant damage at the start of each of the seraph's turns. The seraph can have only one creature swallowed at a time.

If the seraph takes 35 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the seraph must succeed on a DC 20 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone condition in a space within 10 feet of the seraph. If the seraph dies, the swallowed creature is no longer restrained condition by it and can escape the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone condition.
