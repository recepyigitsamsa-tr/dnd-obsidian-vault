**Multiattack.** The malphas makes two Longsword attacks or three Shadow Bolt attacks. If both Longsword attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be blinded condition until the end of its next turn, as shadows fill its eyes. A creature that can see through magical darkness has advantage on this saving throw.

**Longsword.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d8 + 4 damage) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10 + 4 damage) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage.

**Shadow Bolt.** {@atk rs} +7 to hit to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}14 (3d6 + 4 damage) necrotic damage.

## Reactions

**Shadow Call.** When the malphas is hit by a ranged attack, it can make one Shadow Bolt attack against the attacker. The malphas doesn't have disadvantage on this attack from being within 5 feet of a hostile creature, though it may still have disadvantage from other sources.
