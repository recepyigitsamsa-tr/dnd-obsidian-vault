**Haunted Zone.** {@actSave con} DC 17 Saving Throw, any creature that casts a spell while inside the revenant's space. {@actSaveFail} The spell fails and is wasted.

**Undead Restoration.** If the revenant dies, it revives 24 hours later unless Dispel Evil and Good|XPHB spell is cast on its remains. If it revives, it animates another Gargantuan object or structure elsewhere on the same plane of existence; it now looks different but uses the same stat block and returns with all its {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}.

**Multiattack.** The revenant makes two {@variantrule Object|XPHB} Slam attacks and uses Invitation.

**Object Slam.** {@atkr m,r} +9 to hit (with {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} if the target is inside the revenant's space), reach 10 ft. or range 30/90 ft. {@h}27 (5d8 + 5 damage) Bludgeoning damage.

**Invitation.** {@actSave cha} DC 17 Saving Throw, each creature in a 60-foot {@variantrule Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB|Cone}. {@actSaveFail} The target is teleported inside the revenant's space and swallowed. A swallowed creature has {@variantrule Cover|XPHB|Total Cover} against attacks and other effects outside the revenant.

While the revenant has {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, a swallowed creature can leave the revenant's space only by using magic that enables planar travel, such as the Plane Shift|XPHB spell spell.
