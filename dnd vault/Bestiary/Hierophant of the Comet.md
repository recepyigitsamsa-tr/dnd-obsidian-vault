Each creature within the sphere has the blinded condition and deafened condition conditions. Each creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (6d8 damage) psychic damage and has the incapacitated condition condition until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. The manifestation persists until the hierophant dies, has the incapacitated condition condition, uses a bonus action to end the effect, or uses this action again.
