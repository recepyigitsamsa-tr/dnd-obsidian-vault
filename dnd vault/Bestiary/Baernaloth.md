|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |

**Multiattack.** The baernaloth makes one Anguishing Bite attack and one Claw attack. It can also use Teleport.

**Anguishing Bite.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 (1d10 + 4 damage) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6 damage) psychic damage. If the target is a creature, it can't regain hit points until the start of the baernaloth's next turn.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}11 (2d6 + 4 damage) slashing damage plus 17 (5d6 damage) necrotic damage.

**Miasma of Discord {@recharge 5}.** The baernaloth exhales gray vapors that coalesce at a point it can see within 120 feet of itself. The vapors fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point, then vanish. Each non-yugoloth creature in that area must make a DC 19 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 35 (10d6 damage) psychic damage and has the charmed condition condition until the end of its next turn. A creature charmed condition in this way treats its allies as foes, and the colors of its body and equipment become shades of gray. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

**Summon Yugoloth (1/Day).** The baernaloth has a 50 percent chance of summoning its choice of {@dice 1d4} mezzoloths, 1 arcanaloth, or 1 baernaloth (the mezzoloth and arcanaloth appear in the Monster Manual). A summoned yugoloth appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the baernaloth, acts as an ally of the baernaloth, and can't summon other yugoloths. It remains for 1 minute, until it or the baernaloth dies, or until the baernaloth dismisses it as an action.

**Teleport.** The baernaloth teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

## Reactions

**Afflict Despair.** When a creature that the baernaloth can see within 60 feet of itself hits with an attack roll or succeeds on a saving throw, the baernaloth forces the creature to reroll the {@dice d20} and use the new result.

**Inescapable Pain.** When the baernaloth is damaged by another creature, that creature must make a DC 19 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6 damage) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
