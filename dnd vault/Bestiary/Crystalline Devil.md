## Traits

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the crystalline devil's darkvision.

**False Appearance (Gemstone Form Only).** While the devil remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary gemstone.

**Glittering Temptation (Gemstone Form Only).** The devil sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. Each creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the devil and that can see it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be charmed condition for 1 minute. While charmed condition, a creature is incapacitated condition and must move on its turn toward the devil by the safest route, trying to get within 5 feet of the devil to hold it. The charmed condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a success, a creature is also immune to this devil's Glittering Temptation for the next 24 hours. A creature charmed condition by the devil has disadvantage on the saving throw against Crystalline Spray.

**Magic Resistance.** The crystalline devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
