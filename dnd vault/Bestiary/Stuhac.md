## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Bite | +11 to hit | 4d6 + 6 damage) piercing | - |
| Claw | +11 to hit | 5d8 + 6 damage) slashing | - |
| Hobble | DC 18 | 3d8 damage) force | - |
| Illusory Appearance | DC 20 | - | - |

**Multiattack.** The stuhac can use Hobble. It then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}20 (4d6 + 6 damage) piercing damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}28 (5d8 + 6 damage) slashing damage.

**Hobble.** The stuhac telekinetically tears the tendons and ligaments of one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 13 (3d8 damage) force damage and its speed is reduced by 10 feet. The stuhac can't reduce a creature's speed below 0 feet with this action. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest or until removed by the greater restoration spell spell or similar magic.

**Illusory Appearance.** The stuhac covers itself and anything it is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes it look like another creature of its general size and Humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the stuhac takes a bonus action to end it or if the stuhac dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the stuhac could appear to have gnarled hands, but someone touching the stuhac's hands would feel its jagged claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to discern that the stuhac is disguised.
