**Multiattack.** The councilor makes two Radiant Touch attacks.

**Radiant Touch.** {@atk ms} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 (3d6 + 5 damage) radiant damage.

**Healing Touch (3/Day).** The councilor touches another creature. The target magically regains 18 ({@dice 3d8 + 5}) hit points and is freed from one curse afflicting it (councilor's choice).

**Flame Strike (5th-Level Spell; Requires a Spell Slot).** The councilor chooses a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 14 (4d6 damage) fire damage and 14 (4d6 damage) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the councilor casts this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (its choice) increases by {@dice 1d6} for each slot level above 5th.

## Legendary Actions

**Shimmering Aura (Costs 2 Actions).** The councilor channels positive energy into its Aura of Radiance.

Any creature that starts its turn in the bright light must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be blinded condition until the end of the councilor's next turn.
