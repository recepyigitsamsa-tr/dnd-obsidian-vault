**Multiattack.** The drowned maiden makes three Hair attacks. She can replace one attack with a use of Draining Kiss.

**Hair.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d8 + 3 damage) slashing damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 16 Saving Throw) if it is a Large or smaller creature. She can grapple up to three creatures at a time. The hair holding a creature can be attacked and destroyed (AC 15; 15 hp; immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage).

**Draining Kiss.** One creature within 5 feet of the maiden and that she is grappling must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 10 (3d6 damage) psychic damage, and its Strength is reduced by {@dice 1d6}. On a success, the target takes half the damage, and its Strength isn't reduced. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its Strength is reduced to 0.

**Illusory Appearance.** The maiden covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and Humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the maiden takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to discern that the maiden is disguised.
