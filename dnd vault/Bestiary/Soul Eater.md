**Multiattack.** The soul eater makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 (2d6 + 6 damage) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6 damage) psychic damage.

**Hasten Consumption {@recharge 5}.** The soul eater emits a wave of psychic energy to hasten the demise of nearby creatures, bringing them one step closer to having their souls consumed. Each creature within 20 feet of the soul eater must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw, taking 31 (9d6 damage) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to below half its hp maximum by this effect has disadvantage on the saving throw against the soul eater's Soul Drain for 1 minute.

## Reactions

**Soul Drain.** When the soul eater reduces a target to 0 hp, the soul eater consumes that creature's soul. The victim must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or immediately die as the soul eater consumes its soul. A creature killed in this way can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell spell. If the soul eater is killed within 120 feet of the body of a soul it consumed and the victim has been dead for no longer than 1 minute, the victim's soul returns to the body and returns to life, unconscious condition and stable with 0 hp.
