**Shadow Touch.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}17 (3d8 + 4 damage) necrotic damage, and the target's Strength score is reduced by {@dice 1d4}. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.

The vampire can have no more than five shadows under its control at one time.

**Umbral Grasp.** The umbral vampire sends a giant hand of shadow to grab one creature it can see that is in dim light or darkness within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or be restrained condition by wisps of magical shadow for 1 minute. While restrained condition, the target takes 9 (2d8 damage) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The umbral vampire can have no more than two creatures restrained condition by its Umbral Grasp at a time.
