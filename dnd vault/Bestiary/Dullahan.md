## Traits

**Baleful Glare.** When a creature that can see the eyes of the dullahan's severed head starts its turn within 30 feet of the dullahan, the dullahan can force it to make a DC 17 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw if the dullahan isn't incapacitated condition and can see the creature. On a failed save, the creature is frightened condition until the start of its next turn. While frightened condition in this way, the creature must take the Dash action and move away from the dullahan by the safest available route. A doomed creature that fails this saving throw is restrained condition while frightened condition instead.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the dullahan until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the dullahan in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

**Relentless Advance.** Moving through difficult terrain doesn't cost the dullahan extra movement, and the dullahan can move across the surface of water as if it were harmless, solid ground.

**Relentless Nature.** The dullahan doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
