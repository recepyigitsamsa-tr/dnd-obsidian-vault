## Actions

| Bite | +5 to hit | 1d4 + 3 damage) piercing | - |

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 (1d4 + 3 damage) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed condition until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target can't be paralyzed condition in this way by the skin bat again for 24 hours.

In addition, the skin bat attaches to the target. While attached, the skin bat can't attack, and at the start of each of the bat's turns, the target takes 5 (1d4 + 3 damage) piercing damage. The attached bat moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the bat's movement. It can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the skin bat by succeeding on a DC 11 Saving Throw Strength check.

## Reactions

**Attract Bats (1/Day).** When the skin bat is reduced to below half its hp maximum while underground or outside at night, it releases a high-frequency cry similar to that of an injured bat, attracting other bats to it. On initiative count 20 of the next round, {@dice 1d6} bats arrive and aid the skin bat. These bats aren't under the skin bat's control, but they protect it to the best of their abilities, attacking those that harm the skin bat.
