## Traits

**Death Burst.** The gas spore explodes when it drops to 0 hit points. Each creature within 20 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6 damage) poison damage and become infected with a disease on a failed save. Creatures immune to the poisoned condition condition are immune to this disease.

Spores invade an infected creature's system, killing the creature in a number of hours equal to {@dice 1d12} + the creature's Constitution score, unless the disease is removed. In half that time, the creature becomes poisoned condition for the rest of the duration. After the creature dies, it sprouts {@dice 2d4} Tiny gas spores that grow to full size in 7 days.

**Eerie Resemblance.** The gas spore resembles a beholder. A creature that can see the gas spore can discern its true nature with a successful DC 15 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check.
