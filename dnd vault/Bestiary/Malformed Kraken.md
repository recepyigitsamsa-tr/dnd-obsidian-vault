**Tentacle.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}14 (2d6 + 7 damage) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 16 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Fling.** One Medium or smaller object held or creature grappled condition by the kraken's tentacles is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone condition. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6 damage) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone condition.

A target must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10 damage) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
