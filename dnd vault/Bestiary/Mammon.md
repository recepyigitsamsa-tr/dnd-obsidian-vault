| Golden Gaze {@recharge} | DC 23 | - | - |

**Multiattack.** Mammon uses Fearful Gaze, then makes four attacks using Tail Swipe, Constrict, or a combination of the two.

**Tail Swipe.** {@atk mw} +17 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}31 (4d10 + 9 damage) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the grappled condition condition (escape DC 21 Saving Throw). While grappled condition, the creature also has the restrained condition condition, and Mammon can't make Tail Swipe attacks.

**Fearful Gaze.** Mammon focuses his gaze in a 90-foot cone in front of him. Each creature of his choice within the cone must make a DC 23 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw, taking 19 (3d12 damage) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save have the frightened condition condition until the end of their next turn.

**Constrict.** Mammon tightens his grip around a creature he has grappled condition. The target takes 35 (4d12 + 9 damage) bludgeoning damage.

**Golden Gaze {@recharge}.** Mammon attempts to turn one creature he can see within 60 feet of him into solid gold. The target must make a DC 23 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target's flesh begins to harden, and it has the restrained condition condition. A restrained condition creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of each turn. If it successfully saves three times, the effect ends. If it fails three times, it turns to gold and now has the petrified condition condition. Successes and failures don't need to be consecutive.

## Legendary Actions

**Change Form.** Mammon changes his form into that of a pit fiend, maintaining his statistics but losing his actions. He gains the actions and mobility of a pit fiend, including its weapon, and maintains his legendary actions and lair actions. Mammon's serpentine abilities can still recharge while he is in pit fiend form. If Mammon is already a pit fiend, this action changes him back into his serpentine form.

**Golden Touch (Costs 2 Actions).** Mammon recharges Golden Gaze.

**Call Underling (Costs 3 Actions).** Mammon summons an allied horned devil in an unoccupied space that he can see.


## Reactions

**Pain Tax.** As a reaction to taking damage, Mammon causes the attacker's valuables to glow red hot. This deals 3 (1d6 damage) fire damage to the attacker for every 100 gold (or equivalent in gems, jewelry, and other coinage) that it currently carries.
