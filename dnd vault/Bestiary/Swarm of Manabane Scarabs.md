## Traits

**Limited Magic Immunity.** The swarm of manabane scarabs can't be affected or detected by spells of 2nd level or lower unless it wishes to be. It has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects.

**Sense Magic.** The swarm of manabane scarabs senses magic within 120 feet of it at will. This trait otherwise works like the detect magic spell spell but isn't itself magical.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hp or gain temporary hp.

**Bites.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. {@h}28 (8d6 damage) piercing damage, or 14 (4d6 damage) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer, and the swarm can attempt to end one random magical effect of 2nd level or lower on the target. This effect works like the dispel magic spell spell, except the swarm must always make an ability check. Its ability check for this is +5.
