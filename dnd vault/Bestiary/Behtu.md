**Fire Breath {@recharge}.** The behtu exhales fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6 damage) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Ichorous Infusion.** The behtu ingests an infusion made from Mechuiti's blood. For 1 minute, the behtu has advantage on saving throws and ability checks that use Strength and Constitution, and its walking and climbing speeds are doubled. In addition, it has disadvantage on saving throws and ability checks that use Intelligence and Wisdom for the duration. A non-behtu that ingests the infusion must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 10 (3d6 damage) poison damage and is poisoned condition for 1 minute. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned condition. The behtu typically has {@dice 1d4 + 1} infusions in its possession.
