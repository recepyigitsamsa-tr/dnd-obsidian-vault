## Traits

**Berserk.** Whenever the lenchtahg starts its turn with 54 hit points or fewer, roll a {@dice d6}. On a 1, the lenchtahg recalls its former life and current agony, and it goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the lenchtahg attacks the nearest creature it can see. It treats all creatures as enemies and makes any opportunity attack it can. Also, it has advantage on attack rolls, but all attack rolls against it have advantage. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the lenchtahg moves as far as it can toward the closest creature.

Once the lenchtahg goes berserk, it remains so until destroyed or it has more than 54 hit points. Also, a fiend can calm the lenchtahg. The lenchtahg must be able to understand the fiend, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Saving Throw Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. If the check succeeds, the lenchtahg ceases being berserk.

**Magic Resistance.** The lenchtahg has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The lenchtahg's weapon attacks are magical.

**Radiant Absorption.** Whenever the lenchtahg is subjected to radiant damage from a source other than a lenchtahg, it takes no damage and instead regains hit points equal to half the radiant damage dealt to it.

**Rejuvenation.** If the lenchtahg's head survives its demise, the head must be doused in holy water and ritually consecrated in a 1-hour ceremony or be the target of a dispel evil and good spell spell. If it isn't, then the lenchtahg reappears in 6 days, emerging from a fiery explosion in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the head. Creatures in that area must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 8d6 damage damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. The head can't rejuvenate in a holy hallow spell spell's area.

**Water Aversion.** If drenched in 5 gallons or more of water, or any amount of holy water, the lenchtahg has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.
