## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Sickening Claw | +11 to hit | 1d8 + 5 damage) slashing damage plus 13 (3d8 damage) acid | - |

**Multiattack.** The avatar makes four Sickening Claw attacks. It can replace one of the attacks with Insect Gorge (if available).

**Sickening Claw.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 (1d8 + 5 damage) slashing damage plus 13 (3d8 damage) acid damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by the acid damage taken. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**Insect Gorge {@recharge 4}.** The avatar disgorges a swarm of biting flies at a point it can see within 300 feet of itself. Each creature within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 19 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 55 (10d10 damage) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The biting flies persist for 1 minute or until the avatar is slain. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the insects' area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

**Caustic Slimepool (1/Day).** The avatar causes caustic slime to emanate from itself, covering a 15-foot-radius circle. Each creature within the slime must succeed on a DC 19 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or have the grappled condition condition (escape DC 17 Saving Throw). A grappled condition creature takes 21 (6d6 damage) acid damage at the start of its turn.
