**Stings.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. {@h}10 (3d4 + 3 damage) piercing damage, or 5 (1d4 + 3 damage) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. Additionally, if the swarm is on an Outer Plane, it injects the target with a toxin, the effect of which is determined by the swarm's location:

**Upper Plane.** The target sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius until the end of its next turn. During that time, the invisible condition condition has no effect on it.

**Neutral Plane.** If the target is {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell or similar effect, it loses its {@status concentration}.

**Lower Plane.** The target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.

**Dazzling Lights {@recharge}.** The swarm shines its lights in a dazzling display. Each creature within 15 feet of the swarm must succeed on a DC 10 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or have the stunned condition condition for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
