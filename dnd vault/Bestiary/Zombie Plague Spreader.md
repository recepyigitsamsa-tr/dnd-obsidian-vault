**Slam.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 (1d6 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8 damage) necrotic damage.

**Virulent Miasma (1/Day).** The plague spreader releases toxic gas in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6 damage) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies and rises as a zombie (see its stat block in the Monster Manual) 1 minute later. The zombie acts immediately after the plague spreader in the initiative count.
