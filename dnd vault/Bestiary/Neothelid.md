## Traits

**Creature Sense.** The neothelid is aware of the presence of creatures within 1 mile of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each creature's Intelligence score, but can't sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a mind blank spell spell, a nondetection spell spell, or similar magic can't be perceived in this manner.

**Magic Resistance.** The neothelid has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
