The transformed creature's only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet, and it can enter and occupy the space of another creature. In addition, the transformed target can't talk, attack, cast spells, or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The transformed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 13 (3d8 damage) necrotic damage on a failed save, or ending the effect on itself on a successful one. A creature killed by this effect can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell spell.
