## Traits

**False Presence.** The berstuc detects as a Fey when sensed by spells and features, such as the detect evil and good spell spell or a paladin's Divine Sense. However, it is still a Fiend and can be subjected to spells and features that affect Fiends, such as Divine Smite. Beasts and Plants find the berstuc's presence soothing and don't attack the berstuc unless ordered to or provoked.

**Forest Camouflage.** The berstuc has advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks made to hide in forest terrain.

**Magic Resistance.** The berstuc has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Twisted Path.** While in a nonmagical forest, the berstuc leaves no trail and can't be tracked, except by magical means. Creatures of the berstuc's choice within 30 feet of it that travel with it can't retrace their own trails, and become hopelessly lost after 1 hour of travel with the berstuc. Creatures led astray by the berstuc have disadvantage on ability checks to discern their location or to navigate for 24 hours.

**Verdant Nature.** The berstuc doesn't require food or sleep.

**Multiattack.** The berstuc makes three Slam attacks. If two Slam attacks hit a Medium or smaller creature, the berstuc can use Enclose on it.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}19 (3d8 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 17 Saving Throw) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the berstuc doesn't have two other creatures grappled condition.

**Enclose.** The berstuc encloses a Medium or smaller creature grappled condition by it in a mossy growth on the berstuc's body, and the grapple ends. While enclosed in the berstuc's growth, the target is blinded condition and restrained condition, it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} from attacks and other effects outside the berstuc, and it takes 21 (6d6 damage) poison damage at the start of each of the berstuc's turns. The berstuc can have only one creature enclosed at a time.

If the berstuc takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside its growth, the berstuc must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or expel the enclosed creature as the growth bursts. The expelled creature falls prone condition in a space within 5 feet of the berstuc. If the berstuc dies, an enclosed creature is no longer restrained condition by it and can escape from the growth by using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone condition.
