**Spell Mimicry {@recharge 5}.** The living spell creates a 40-foot-diameter sphere of fog within 60 feet of it (the fog spreads around corners). When a creature enters the fog for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (5d8 damage) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
