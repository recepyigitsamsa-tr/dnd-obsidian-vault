**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}17 (2d10 + 6 damage) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8 damage) necrotic damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled condition (escape DC 19 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition, and the dragon can't bite a different target.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft. one target. {@h}10 (1d8 + 6 damage) slashing damage.

**Cataclysmic Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a wave of ghostly purple flames in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8 damage) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature dies if the breath reduces it to 0 hit points. Additionally, any Medium or smaller Humanoid killed by the breath's damage, as well as every corpse of such a creature within the cone, becomes a zombie (see the Monster Manual) under the dragon's control. The zombie acts on the dragon's initiative but immediately after the dragon's turn. Absent any other command, the zombie tries to kill any non-Undead creature it encounters.

## Legendary Actions

**Claw.** The dragon makes one Claw attack.

**Cataclysmic Rush (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon moves up to half its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks, carrying with it any creatures it is grappling. During this move, if it enters the space of a Medium or smaller creature, that creature takes 4 (1d8 damage) necrotic damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.
