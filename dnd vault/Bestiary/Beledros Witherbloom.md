**Decaying Breath {@recharge 5}.** Beledros exhales decaying energy in a 90-foot cone.

A creature that takes damage from the breath can't regain hit points until the start of Beledros's next turn.

**Miasmal Flow.** Beledros becomes a swirling cloud of green mist and can move up to half her flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks, then resumes her true form.

If she moves through a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or become poisoned condition until the end of its next turn.
