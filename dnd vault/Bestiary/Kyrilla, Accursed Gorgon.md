## Traits

**Feed on Pain (2/Day).** The first time she hits with a weapon attack on her turn, Kyrilla can deal an extra 16 (3d10 damage) poison damage to the target and regains a number of hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If she fails a saving throw, Kyrilla can choose to succeed instead.

**Petrifying Gaze.** When a creature that can see Kyrilla's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of her, Kyrilla can force it to make a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw if Kyrilla isn't incapacitated condition and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified condition. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained condition. The restrained condition creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified condition on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell spell or other magic.

Unless {@status surprised}, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see Kyrilla until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Kyrilla in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

Kyrilla's accursed gaze does not affect undead or constructs. If Kyrilla sees herself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of her and in an area of bright light, she is, due to her curse, affected by her own gaze.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, Kyrilla has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on sight.
