## Traits

**Aura of Servile Avians.** Any evil creature with a natural fly speed and a CR of 20 or less must make a DC 21 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw if they attempt to attack Pazuzu. A failed save means their action is wasted and the attack fails. On a successful saving throw the target is immune to this effect in the future.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Pazuzu fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Pazuzu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** Pazuzu's weapon attacks are magical.

**Talon.** {@atk mw} +14 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 (2d8 + 6 damage) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8 damage) poison damage.

**Breath Weapons {@recharge 5}.** Pazuzu exhales poisonous acid in a 100-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Every creature hit by the acid must make a DC 21 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6 damage) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature killed by this breath weapon melts and is disintegrated.

## Legendary Actions

**Disarm.** Pazuzu attempts to knock a weapon out of a target's hand. He makes a Greatsword attack and if it hits, the target does not take damage but instead must make a DC 22 Saving Throw Strength saving throw. If the target fails the saving throw, the targeted weapon flies 10 feet away in a random direction.

**Lethal Leap.** Pazuzu attacks once with his Greatsword or Talon and then may fly up to 60 feet away. Pazuzu's movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
