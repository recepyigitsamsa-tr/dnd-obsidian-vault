## Traits

**False Appearance.** If the spider is motionless, has its eyes and mouth closed, and has its legs wrapped around its body at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the spider move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to discern that the spider is anything other than an asteroid.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the spider fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Unusual Nature.** The spider doesn't require air.
