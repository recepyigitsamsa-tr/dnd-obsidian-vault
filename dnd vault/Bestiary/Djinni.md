**Multiattack.** The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.

**Scimitar.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d6 + 5 damage) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6 damage) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's choice).

**Create Whirlwind.** A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains {@status concentration} (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be restrained condition by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained condition by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained condition by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Saving Throw Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained condition and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.
