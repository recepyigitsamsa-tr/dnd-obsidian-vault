**Multiattack.** The amalgamation uses its Contaminating Presence. It then makes three tentacle attacks, each of which it can replace with one use of Fling.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +17 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}23 (3d8 + 10 damage) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled condition by the amalgamation, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends.

While swallowed, the creature is blinded condition and restrained condition, it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside the amalgamation, and it takes 42 (12d6 damage) acid damage and gains one {@adventure level of contamination|DoDk|12} at the start of each of the amalgamation's turns.

If the amalgamation takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the amalgamation must succeed on a DC 25 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone condition in a space within 10 feet of the amalgamation. If the amalgamation dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained condition by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone condition.

**Tentacle.** {@atk mw} +17 to hit to hit, reach 50 ft., one target. {@h}20 (3d6 + 10 damage) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 18 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition. The amalgamation has twelve tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Fling.** One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled condition by the amalgamation is thrown up to 60 feet in a direction of the amalgamation's choice and knocked prone condition. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6 damage) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone condition.

**Mind-breaking Whispers.** The amalgamation utters a terrible truth within the mind of one creature within 120 feet of it. That creature must succeed on a DC 20 Saving Throw Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, it takes 35 (10d6 damage) psychic damage and becomes insane until it finishes a long rest. While insane, it can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and can speak only in gibberish. A greater restoration spell spell cast on the creature ends this effect.

**Contaminating Presence.** Humanoid creatures within 120 feet of the amalgamation must succeed on a DC 20 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage and gain one {@adventure level of contamination|DoDk|12}.
