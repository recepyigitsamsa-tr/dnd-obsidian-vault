Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (8d10 damage) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the dragonborn uses this action, it can choose up to three creatures in the cone. These creatures take no damage from the radiance and instead regain 22 ({@dice 4d10}) hit points each.
