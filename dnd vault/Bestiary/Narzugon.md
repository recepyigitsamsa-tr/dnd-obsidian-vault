**Hellfire Lance.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}11 (1d12 + 5 damage) piercing damage plus 16 (3d10 damage) fire damage. If this damage kills a creature, the creature's soul rises from the River Styx as a lemure in Avernus in {@dice 1d4} hours.

If the creature isn't revived before then, only a wish spell spell or killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature's original body can restore it to life. Constructs and devils are immune to this effect.

**Terrifying Command.** Each creature that isn't a fiend within 60 feet of the narzugon that can hear it must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw or become frightened condition of it for 1 minute.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that makes a successful saving throw is immune to this narzugon's Terrifying Command for 24 hours.

**Healing (1/Day).** The narzugon, or one creature it touches, regains up to 100 hit points.
