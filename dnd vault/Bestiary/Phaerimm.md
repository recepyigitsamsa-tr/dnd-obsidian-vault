**Multiattack.** The phaerimm makes four Claw attacks and then makes a Bite or Stinger attack. Alternatively, it uses Spellcasting and then makes two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}18 (2d12 + 5 damage) piercing damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d6 + 5 damage) slashing damage.

**Stinger.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d6 + 5 damage) piercing damage. If the target fails a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, they have the paralyzed condition condition for 1 minute. The phaerimm's poison forces the paralyzed condition target to float 5 feet above the ground. The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of it's turns.

**Implant.** The phaerimm makes a Stinger attack against a paralyzed condition target. If the stinger hits, an egg is implanted in the target. This egg can only be removed by spells that cure disease, such as lesser restoration. If the egg is not removed within 90 days, the larva emerges, and the host is killed. A phaerimm has a single egg so may only use this ability once.
