## Traits

**Absorb.** Any nonmagical object that touches the xanka's central globe, any nonmagical weapon that hits the xanka, or any nonmagical object, structure, or creature hit by the xanka's Dismantling Leg attack begins to deteriorate. If it is a structure or an object that isn't being worn or carried, up to a 1-foot cube of the structure or object is destroyed.

If it is an object worn or carried by a creature, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw to avoid the item being affected by the xanka's Absorb. If the object is a weapon, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If the weapon's penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. If the object is armor or a shield, the armor or shield takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If the target is a creature, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4 damage) necrotic damage.

**Construct Nature.** The xanka doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
