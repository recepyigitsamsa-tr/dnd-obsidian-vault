**Keen Smell.** The kamadan has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on smell.

**Pounce.** If the kamadan moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn that target must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be knocked prone condition.
