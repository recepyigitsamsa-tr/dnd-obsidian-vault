## Traits

**Demigod's Vitality.** The jotun's ability scores and hp maximum can't be reduced except by means of a wish spell spell.

**Icy Weapons.** The jotun's weapon attacks are magical. When the jotun hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 6d8 damage cold damage (included in the attack).

**Magic Resistance.** The jotun has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Material Bound.** The jotun is immune to any spell or effect that would force it to leave the Material Plane, unless the jotun wants to leave. It has disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would return it to the Material Plane from another plane of existence.

**Too Big to Notice.** While the jotun remains motionless in nonmagical, natural terrain, it has advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks.

**Multiattack.** The jotun can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three Greatclub or Rock attacks.

**Greatclub.** {@atk mw} +17 to hit to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}28 (4d8 + 10 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 27 (6d8 damage) cold damage.

**Rock.** {@atk rw} +17 to hit to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. {@h}32 (4d10 + 10 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 27 (6d8 damage) cold damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the jotun's choice within 120 feet of the jotun and aware of it must succeed on a DC 20 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or become frightened condition for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the jotun's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Icy Sweep {@recharge 5}.** The jotun swings its ice-coated greatclub in a wide arc. Each creature within 20 feet of the jotun must make a DC 23 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 36 (8d8 damage) bludgeoning damage and 54 (12d8 damage) cold damage and is pushed up to 15 feet away from the jotun and knocked prone condition. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't pushed or knocked prone condition.

## Reactions

**Rock Catching.** If a rock or similar object is hurled at the jotun, the jotun can, with a successful DC 10 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, catch the missile and take no bludgeoning damage from it.
