**Ashen Burst.** {@atk ms,rs} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. {@h}17 (5d6 damage) fire damage.

**Cinder Spite {@recharge 5}.** Charmayne creates a magical explosion of fire centered on a point she can see within 120 feet of herself. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6 damage) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies and is transformed into a Tiny charcoal figurine.

## Reactions

**Charmayne can take up to three reactions per round but only one per turn..** 

**Elemental Rebuke.** In response to being hit by an attack, Charmayne utters a word in Ignan, dealing 10 (3d6 damage) fire damage to the attacker. Charmayne then teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space she can see, leaving a harmless cloud of ash and embers in the space she just left.

**Fiery Counterspell.** Charmayne interrupts a creature she can see within 60 feet of herself that is casting a spell. If the spell is 4th level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If the spell is 5th level or higher, Charmayne makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 Saving Throw + the spell's level). On a success, the spell fails and has no effect. Whatever the spell's level, the caster takes 10 (3d6 damage) fire damage if the spell fails.
