**Web Walker.** The spythronar swarm ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Bites | +5 to hit | 4d4 damage) piercing damage and 9 (2d8 damage) lightning | - |
| Weave (4/Day) | DC 10 | - | - |

**Bites.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. {@h}10 (4d4 damage) piercing damage and 9 (2d8 damage) lightning damage, or 5 (2d4 damage) piercing damage and 4 (1d8 damage) lightning damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

**Weave (4/Day).** The spythronar swarm weaves webbing, covering a 5-foot square. The swarm can then give up 1 hit point to create a spythronar sac in that space. If the swarm's webbing covers a 10-foot square, it can give up 23 hit points as part of the same action, creating a spythronar web with the same number of hit points. The swarm can't drop to 0 hit points to create a sac or web.

If the swarm weaves an incomplete web, that web is a normal web rather than a sentient, monstrous one. A creature that enters this normal web's space must succeed on a DC 10 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or become grappled condition (escape DC 10 Saving Throw) and restrained condition while grappled condition in this way. Each 5-foot square of this web has AC 10; the damage vulnerabilities, immunities, and resistances of a spythronar web; and 5 hit points.
