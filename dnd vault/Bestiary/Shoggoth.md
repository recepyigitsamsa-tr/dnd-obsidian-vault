## Traits

**Anaerobic Nature.** The shoggoth doesn't require air.

**Absorb Flesh.** When the shoggoth kills a creature while within 15 feet of it, the creature's body is absorbed into the shoggoth's. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell spell.

**Amorphous.** The shoggoth can move through a space as narrow as 1 foot wide without squeezing.

**Hideous Cacophony.** The shoggoth's many mouths constantly emit whistles, fluting, and other high-pitched noises. It has disadvantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks made to be unheard. Each creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the shoggoth and that can hear it must make a DC 19 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be disoriented until the start of its next turn. A disoriented creature is incapacitated condition, and when it moves, it moves in a random direction.

Unless surprised, a creature can cover its ears to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't hear until the start of its next turn, when it can cover its ears again. If the creature uncovers its ears in the meantime while within 60 feet of the shoggoth, it must immediately make the save. A creature that is covering its ears and that has access to cloth, wax, or similar material can stuff its ears with the material as a bonus action to free up its hands, deafening itself while the material remains stuffed in its ears.

**Keen Hearing and Smell.** The shoggoth has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

**Limited Mutability.** Any spell or effect that would alter the shoggoth's form alters it for only 1 round. Afterward, the shoggoth returns to its amorphous blob form.

**Crush.** The shoggoth crushes up to two creatures it is grappling by rolling them beneath its bulk. Each target must succeed on a DC 19 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or take 30 (4d10 + 8 damage) bludgeoning damage, be unable to breathe, and be restrained condition until the grapple ends. If the shoggoth moves, a creature beneath it is no longer restrained condition and is able to breathe, but it remains grappled condition.
