**Scroll Bash.** {@atk ms} +4 to hit to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. {@h}7 (1d10 + 2 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8 damage) thunder damage.

**Reduce to Memory {@recharge}.** Thundering golden energy erupts around a creature the apprentice can see within 90 feet of it. The creature must make a DC 12 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 33 (6d10 damage) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Construct has disadvantage on the saving throw.

**Learn from the Past (2/Day).** When another creature within 60 feet of the apprentice misses a target with an attack roll, the apprentice magically enables the attacker to reroll the attack roll. It must use the new roll.
