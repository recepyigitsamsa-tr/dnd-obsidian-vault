## Traits

**Confusing Burble.** The jabberwock burbles to itself unless it is incapacitated condition. Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the jabberwock and is able to hear its burbling must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn, and it rolls a {@dice d4} to determine what it does during its current turn:

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the jabberwock fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Regeneration.** The jabberwock regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the jabberwock takes slashing damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn. The jabberwock dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Uncanny Tracker.** The jabberwock can unerringly track any creature it has wounded in the last 24 hours, and it knows the distance and direction to its quarry as long as the two of them are on the same plane of existence.
