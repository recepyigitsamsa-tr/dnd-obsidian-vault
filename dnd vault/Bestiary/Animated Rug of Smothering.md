## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Smother | +5 to hit | 2d6 + 3 damage) Bludgeoning | - |

**Smother.** {@atkr m} +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. {@h}10 (2d6 + 3 damage) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, the rug can give it the Grappled|XPHB condition condition (escape DC 13 Saving Throw) instead of dealing damage. Until the grapple ends, the target has the Blinded|XPHB condition and Restrained|XPHB condition conditions, is suffocating, and takes 10 (2d6 + 3 damage) Bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. The rug can smother only one creature at a time.

While grappling the target, the rug can't take this action, the rug halves the damage it takes (round down), and the target takes the same amount of damage.
