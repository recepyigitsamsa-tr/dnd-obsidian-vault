**Arcane Bolt.** {@atk rs} +8 to hit to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}28 (8d6 damage) force damage.

**Thundering Blast {@recharge 5}.** Oshundo emits a wave of domineering energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (4d8 + 4 damage) thunder damage and have the stunned condition condition for 1 minute. A stunned condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Reactions

**Negate Spell (3/Day).** Oshundo targets one creature it can perceive within 60 feet of itself that is casting a spell. If the spell is 3rd level or lower, the spell fails, but any spell slots or charges aren't wasted.
