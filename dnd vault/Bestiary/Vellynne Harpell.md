If Vellynne casts this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the necrotic damage increases by 1d6 damage for each slot level above 3rd.

**Chill Touch (Cantrip).** {@atk rs} +6 to hit to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. {@h}9 (2d8 damage) necrotic damage, and the target can't regain hit points until the start of Vellynne's next turn.

**Wand of Magic Missiles.** While holding this wand, Vellynne can expend 1 or more of its 7 charges to cast the magic missile spell spell from it. She can expend 1 charge to cast the 1st-level version of the spell. She can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge she expends. The wand regains {@dice 1d6 + 1} expended charges daily at dawn. If the wand's last charge is expended, roll a {@dice d20}; on a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
