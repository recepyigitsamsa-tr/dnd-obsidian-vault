## Traits

**Enfeebling Attacks.** Each time the myling deals necrotic damage to a creature that is below half its hp maximum, the target's Strength score is reduced by {@dice 1d4}. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.

**Undead Nature.** The myling doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Claw | +5 to hit | 2d6 + 3 damage) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) necrotic | - |

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 (2d6 + 3 damage) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or the myling attaches to it. While attached, the myling sinks its teeth into the target and can't attack, and at the start of each of the myling's turns, the target takes 17 (5d6 damage) necrotic damage.

The attached myling moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the myling's movement. It can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the myling by succeeding on a DC 13 Saving Throw Strength check.
