## Traits

**Cold Aura.** At the start of each of Cryonax's turns, each creature within 10 feet of him takes 21 (6d6 damage) cold damage. A creature also takes 21 (6d6 damage) cold damage if they touch or hit Cryonax. Nonmagical weapons that hit Cryonax are frozen immediately after dealing damage to Cryonax. If used again and they hit any creature, the weapon shatters. The freezing effect disappears after an hour.

**Empowered Attacks.** Cryonax's Slam attacks are treated as magical for the purpose of bypassing resistance and immunity to nonmagical weapons.

**Ice Walker.** No ability checks are required when Cryonax walks or climbs across icy surfaces and difficult snow or ice terrain does not cost him extra movement.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Cryonax fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Cryonax has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Legendary Actions

**Smash.** Cryonax slams a grappled condition target against the ground, dealing 13 (3d8 damage) bludgeoning damage to it.

**Tentacle Freeze.** Cryonax's tentacle freezes a grappled condition target. If the target fails a DC 22 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw they are paralyzed condition and Cryonax releases them from its tentacle. They remain frozen indefinitely but can attempt the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of their turns. Success means they are no longer frozen.

**Ice Shroud (Costs 3 Actions).** With a gesture Cryonax targets a frozen creature (see Tentacle Freeze) that is within 30 feet of him. The target is encased instantly in a hard shell of crushing ice. The target receives no saving throw and takes 22 (5d8 damage) cold damage immediately and at the start of each of their turns. The target is considered stunned condition but is partly protected by the shroud and resistant to all damage. The shroud disappears if Cryonax removes it, Cryonax dies, the shroud takes 100 hit points of damage or another character uses their action and succeeds on a DC 22 Saving Throw Strength check to remove the trapped ally.
