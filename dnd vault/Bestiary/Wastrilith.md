## Traits

**Amphibious.** The wastrilith can breathe air and water.

**Corrupt Water.** At the start of each of the wastrilith's turns, exposed water within 30 feet of it is befouled. Underwater, this effect lightly obscures the area until a current clears it away. Water in containers remains corrupted until it evaporates.

A creature that consumes this foul water or swims in it must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the foul water for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6 damage) poison damage and is poisoned condition for 1 minute. At the end of this time, the poisoned condition creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 18 (4d8 damage) poison damage and is poisoned condition until it finishes a long rest.

If another demon drinks the foul water as an action, it gains 11 ({@dice 2d10}) temporary hit points.

**Magic Resistance.** The wastrilith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Undertow.** As a bonus action when the wastrilith is underwater, it can cause all water within 60 feet of it to be {@quickref difficult terrain||3} for other creatures until the start of its next turn.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}18 (4d6 + 4 damage) slashing damage.

**Grasping Spout.** The wastrilith magically launches a spout of water at one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Strength saving throw, and it has disadvantage if it's underwater. On a failed save, it takes 22 (4d8 + 4 damage) acid damage and is pulled up to 60 feet toward the wastrilith. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.
