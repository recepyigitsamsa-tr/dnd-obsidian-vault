## Traits

**Construct Nature.** The fellforged doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Inhabiting Spirit.** The fellforged is inhabited and animated by a specter. If the fellforged fails a saving throw against an effect that turns undead, the specter is expelled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the fellforged with the hp total it had before it was expelled. The specter otherwise uses the statistics of a specter.

Without its animating specter, the fellforged becomes dormant for 1 minute then crumbles to pieces and is destroyed. The expelled specter can reinhabit the dormant fellforged as a bonus action while within 5 feet of the fellforged, making it active again and using the specter's current hp as the fellforged's hp total.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the fellforged has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on sight.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
