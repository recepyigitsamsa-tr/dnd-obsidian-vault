**Multiattack.** The mutate makes two Bite or Tentacle attacks. It can replace one of these attacks with Chitin Slam.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 (2d8 + 4 damage) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition condition. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 ({@dice 1d10}) on a failure. On a successful save, the target is no longer poisoned condition. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until it no longer has the poisoned condition condition.

**Tentacle.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}13 (2d8 + 4 damage) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the grappled condition condition (escape DC 15 Saving Throw) and the restrained condition condition until this grapple ends. The mutate has two tentacles that can grapple one target each.

**Chitin Slam.** The mutate targets one creature it is grappling, slamming the creature against its chitinous plating. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 16 (3d10 damage) bludgeoning damage and have the stunned condition condition until the end of the mutate's next turn.
