**Thunderbolt (2 Actions).** The giant hurls a thunderbolt at a creature it can see within 600 feet of it. The target must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10 damage) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**One with the Storm (3 Actions).** The giant vanishes, dispersing itself into the storm surrounding its lair. The giant can end this effect at the start of any of its turns, becoming a giant once more and appearing in any location it chooses within its lair. While dispersed, the giant can't take any actions other than lair actions, and it can't be targeted by attacks, spells, or other effects. The giant can't use this ability outside its lair, nor can it use this ability if another creature is using a control weather spell spell or similar magic to quell the storm.
