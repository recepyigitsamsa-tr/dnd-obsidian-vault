## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Load | - | - | - |
| Dead Cannon | DC 13 | 2d6 damage) bludgeoning damage and 7 (2d6 damage) necrotic | - |
| Pistol Club | +5 to hit | 1d6 + 2 damage) bludgeoning damage and 3 (1d6 damage) necrotic | - |
| Dead Pistol | +5 to hit | 1d10 + 3 damage) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6 damage) necrotic | - |

**Load.** The skeleton cannoneer loads the dead cannon.

**Dead Cannon.** The skeleton cannoneer fires its loaded cannon at a point it can see within 500 feet of it, but no closer than 50 feet from it. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6 damage) bludgeoning damage and 7 (2d6 damage) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Alternatively, the cannoneer can choose the cannon as the point of fire. Doing so means the shot goes off inside the cannon, destroying it and increasing each type of damage by 3 ({@dice 1d6}).

**Pistol Club.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 (1d6 + 2 damage) bludgeoning damage and 3 (1d6 damage) necrotic damage.

**Dead Pistol.** {@atk rw} +5 to hit to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d10 + 3 damage) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6 damage) necrotic damage.
