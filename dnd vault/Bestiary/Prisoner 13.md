## Traits

**Antimagic Susceptibility.** In an area of antimagic, Prisoner 13's tattoos and reactions don't function, and she suffers the following modifications to her statistics: her AC becomes 13, she loses her immunity to psychic damage and the charmed condition, and her Tattooed Strike becomes a melee attack that deals 7 (1d8 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage on a hit.

**Mindlink Tattoos.** Prisoner 13 has telepathic links with dozens of agents operating throughout the land. The links allow Prisoner 13 to communicate telepathically with each of these agents while they are both on the same plane of existence.

**Mountain Tattoo.** Prisoner 13's AC includes her Constitution modifier.

**Shroud Tattoo.** Prisoner 13 can't be targeted by divination spells or any feature that would read her thoughts, and she can't be perceived through magical scrying sensors. She can't be contacted telepathically unless she allows such contact.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Tattooed Strike | +6 to hit | 2d8 + 3 damage) force | - |
| Firestorm Tattoo {@recharge 5} | DC 15 | 3d8 damage) fire | - |
| River Tattoo | - | - | - |

**Multiattack.** Prisoner 13 makes two Tattooed Strike attacks.

**Tattooed Strike.** {@atk mw,rw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d8 + 3 damage) force damage.

**Firestorm Tattoo {@recharge 5}.** Prisoner 13 magically unleashes flame from the tattoo across her back, filling a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on her. Each other creature in that area must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 13 (3d8 damage) fire damage and is knocked prone condition. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone condition.

**River Tattoo.** Prisoner 13 magically ends any effects causing the grappled condition or restrained condition conditions on herself. If she is bound with nonmagical restraints, she slips out of them.

## Reactions

**Readiness.** When a creature Prisoner 13 can see within 60 feet of herself ends its turn, Prisoner 13 makes one Tattooed Strike attack or uses River Tattoo. She can then move up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
