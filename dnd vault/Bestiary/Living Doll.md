**False Appearance.** If the doll is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the doll move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to discern that the doll is animate.

**Regeneration.** The doll regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn. If the doll takes fire or psychic damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the doll's next turn. The doll is destroyed only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
