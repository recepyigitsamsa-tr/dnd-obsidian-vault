## Reactions

**Banishing Rebuke (Recharges after a Long Rest).** When Avarice is damaged by a creature that she can see within 60 feet of her, she can banish that creature to a frigid extradimensional prison for 1 minute. While there, the creature is incapacitated condition and takes 5 (1d10 damage) cold damage at the start of each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a DC 14 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw, escaping the prison on a success and reappearing in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. A creature that dies in the prison is trapped there indefinitely.
