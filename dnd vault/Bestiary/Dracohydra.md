## Traits

**Multiple Heads.** The dracohydra has five heads. While it has more than one head, the dracohydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded condition, charmed condition, deafened condition, frightened condition, stunned condition, and knocked unconscious condition.

Whenever the dracohydra takes 30 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the dracohydra dies.

At the end of its turn, the dracohydra grows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken radiant damage since its last turn. The dracohydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown this way.

**Reactive Heads.** For each head the dracohydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.

**Wakeful.** While the dracohydra sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake.
