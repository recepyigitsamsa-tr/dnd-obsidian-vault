## Traits

**Arcane Leak.** When the adranach is reduced to half its hit point maximum (85 hit points), its mithral mask cracks and its arcane form begins to waver, creating a field of unstable magic around it. Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the adranach or enters that area for the first time on a turn takes 10 (3d6 damage) radiant damage. Additionally, if a creature casts a spell within this area, it must make a DC 14 Saving Throw ability check using its spellcasting ability. On a failure, the spell backfires, consuming the spell slot and dealing 3 (1d6 damage) force damage to the caster for each level of the spell slot that was consumed.

**Immutable Form.** The adranach is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Magic Weapons.** The adranach's weapon attacks are magical.

**Powerful Build.** The adranach counts as one size larger when determining its carrying capacity and the weight it can push, drag, or lift.
