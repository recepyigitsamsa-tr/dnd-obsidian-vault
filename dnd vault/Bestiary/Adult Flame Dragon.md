A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Fire Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot cone.

Each creature in that area must also succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or go on a rampage for 1 minute. A rampaging creature must attack the nearest creature other than the dragon on its turn. If no other creature is near enough to move to and attack, the rampaging creature stalks off in a random direction, seeking a target for its rage. The rampaging creature can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
