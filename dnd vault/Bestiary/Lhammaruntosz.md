**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of Lhammaruntosz's choice that is within 120 feet of her and aware of her must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or become frightened condition for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Lhammaruntosz's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
