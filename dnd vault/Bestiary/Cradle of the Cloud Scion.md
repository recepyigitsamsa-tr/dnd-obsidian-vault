## Traits

**Awakening of the Scion.** The cradle is a container for the scion of Memnor|BGG. When the cradle drops to 0 hit points, its body dissipates into cloud wisps. The scion instantly appears in the space the cradle occupied and uses the cradle's initiative count.

**Flyby.** The cradle doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Legendary Resistance (5/Day).** If the cradle fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The cradle has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster.** The cradle deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |

| Multiattack | - | - | - |

**Multiattack.** The cradle makes three Slam or Wind Javelin attacks in any combination.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +17 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}31 (4d10 + 9 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 19 (3d12 damage) thunder damage.

**Wind Javelin.** {@atk rw} +17 to hit to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}27 (4d8 + 9 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6 damage) thunder damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 25 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or have the prone condition condition.

**Vortex {@recharge 5}.** The cradle conjures a vortex of wind at a point it can see within 90 feet of itself. The wind vortex is a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Each creature other than the cradle in that area must make a DC 25 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 71 (11d12 damage) bludgeoning damage and has the restrained condition condition within the vortex. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside the cylinder. The vortex lasts until the start of the cradle's next turn. A creature with the restrained condition condition falls prone condition when the vortex ends.

A creature with the restrained condition condition can use its action to try to escape the vortex. The creature makes a DC 19 Saving Throw Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. On a successful check, the creature escapes and moves {@dice 3d6 Ã— 10} feet away from the vortex in a random direction.

## Reactions

**Thunderclap.** Immediately after taking damage, the cradle unleashes a thunderclap in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. All other creatures in that area must succeed on a DC 25 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 18 (4d8 damage) thunder damage and have the deafened condition condition for 1 minute.
