**Magic Resistance.** The hag has {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spiteful Escape.** When the hag drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, it dies only if it is within 30 feet of its anathema (a thing the DM chooses as the hag's most hated thing).

When the hag teleports away, each creature within 60 feet of the space it left is cursed. Until the curse ends, a creature has {@variantrule Disadvantage|XPHB} on ability checks and saving throws, and the hag knows its location anywhere in the multiverse.
