## Traits

**Immortal Nature.** The chained angel doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.

**Magic Resistance.** The chained angel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Redemption.** When a creature casts the knock spell spell on the chained angel's chains, the chains release a blast of unholy flame. The spellcaster must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10 damage) fire damage and 16 (3d10 damage) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the spellcaster survives, the chained angel must immediately make a DC 17 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the angel's chains fall away. It is restored to its senses and the form it had before it was chained, typically a deva. On a failure, the chained angel remains chained for 7 days, and during that time, any further attempts to cast knock spell on the angel's chains fail.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Fiery Greatsword | +7 to hit | 2d6 + 4 damage) slashing damage plus 16 (3d10 damage) fire | - |
| Fallen Glory {@recharge 5} | DC 15 | 3d12 damage) radiant | - |

**Multiattack.** The chained angel makes two Fiery Greatsword attacks.

**Fiery Greatsword.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 (2d6 + 4 damage) slashing damage plus 16 (3d10 damage) fire damage.

**Fallen Glory {@recharge 5}.** Each creature the chained angel can see within 50 feet of it must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 19 (3d12 damage) radiant damage and is knocked prone condition. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone condition.

## Reactions

**Fiendish Cunning.** When a creature the chained angel can see within 60 feet of it casts a spell that appears on the cleric or paladin spell list, the chained angel can counter the spell with a successful ability check. This works like the counterspell spell spell with a +5 spellcasting ability check, except the chained angel must make the ability check no matter the level of the spell.
