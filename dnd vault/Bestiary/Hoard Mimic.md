## Traits

**False Appearance (Hoard Form Only).** If the mimic is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the mimic move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to discern that the mimic is animate.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Bite | +8 to hit | 2d10 + 5 damage) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) acid | - |

**Multiattack.** The mimic makes one Bite attack and two Pseudopod attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}16 (2d10 + 5 damage) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) acid damage.

**Pseudopod.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d6 + 5 damage) bludgeoning damage, and the mimic adheres to the target. A creature adhered to the mimic is also grappled condition by it (escape DC 16 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition. Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage.

**Caustic Mist {@recharge 5}.** The mimic sprays a fine mist of acid in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8 damage) acid damage and is blinded condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded condition.

**Shapechanger.** The mimic transforms into a hoard or back into its true, amorphous form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
