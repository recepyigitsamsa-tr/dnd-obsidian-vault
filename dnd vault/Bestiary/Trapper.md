## Traits

**False Appearance.** While the trapper is attached to a ceiling, floor, or wall and remains motionless, it is almost indistinguishable from an ordinary section of ceiling, floor, or wall. A creature that can see it and succeeds on a DC 20 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) or Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check can discern its presence.

**Spider Climb.** The trapper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Smother.** One Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of the trapper must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or be grappled condition (escape DC 14 Saving Throw). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 17 (4d6 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6 damage) acid damage at the start of each of its turns. While grappled condition in this way, the target is restrained condition, blinded condition, and at risk of suffocating. The trapper can smother only one creature at a time.
