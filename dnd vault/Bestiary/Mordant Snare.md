## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The mordant snare has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Mordant Puppets.** A mordant snare can spend 8 hours draining a dead Humanoid of its fluids and internal organs, replacing them with the snare's acid and filaments. The Humanoid's body then becomes a puppet controlled by the snare. Mordant puppets share a telepathic link with the snare, and each puppet uses the statistics of a zombie. The puppets can't move more than 30 feet away from the snare. The mordant snare can have no more than twelve puppets under its control at one time.

When a puppet is destroyed, each creature within 5 feet of the puppet must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8 damage) acid damage. If the mordant snare dies, all puppets it controls immediately crumble into desiccated husks as the animating acid and filaments leave them.

**Hidden Trap.** While underground, the mordant snare covers itself in dirt, sand, or other material and lurks just below the surface.

When a creature enters the mordant snare's space, the snare can make one Tentacle attack against the creature as a reaction, removing the covering material.
