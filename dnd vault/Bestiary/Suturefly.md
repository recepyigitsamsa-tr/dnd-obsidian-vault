**Sew.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}4 (1d4 + 2 damage) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or the suturefly sews the target's mouth, nose, or one of its eyes closed (the suturefly's choice). With supernatural speed, the suturefly repeatedly pierces the target's face, each time threading a loop of the target's own skin through the previous hole. These skin loops rapidly blacken, shrink, and draw the orifice tightly closed. If a target's mouth is sewn shut, it can't speak. If its mouth and nose are sewn shut, it can't breathe, and if both eyes are sewn shut, it is blinded condition. A creature, including the target, can take its action to cut open one of the sewn orifices by succeeding on a DC 12 Saving Throw Dexterity check with an edged weapon or tool.
