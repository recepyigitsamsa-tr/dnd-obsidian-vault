**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Alustriel fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Special Equipment.** Alustriel carries a magic staff known as the Staff of Silverymoon. In the hands of anyone other than Alustriel, the Staff of Silverymoon is a Staff of Power.

**Multiattack.** Alustriel makes three Staff of Silverymoon attacks or two Reproving Ray attacks.

**Staff of Silverymoon.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}14 (2d8 + 5 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 38 (7d10 damage) radiant damage.

**Reproving Ray.** {@atk rs} +14 to hit to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}65 (9d12 + 7 damage) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it must make a DC 22 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the incapacitated condition condition until the start of Alustriel's next turn. On a successful save, the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of Alustriel's next turn.

**Argent Blaze (Requires Silver Fire).** Alustriel summons a 60-foot cone of silver fire. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 77 (14d10 damage) radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, Alustriel or one creature of her choice within 60 feet of her then regains 10 ({@dice 3d6}) hit points.

## Reactions

**Shining Counterspell.** Alustriel interrupts a creature she can see within 60 feet of herself that is casting a spell. If the spell is 5th level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If the spell is 6th level or higher, Alustriel makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 Saving Throw plus the spell's level). On a successful check, the spell fails and has no effect. Whatever the spell's level, the caster takes 11 (2d10 damage) radiant damage if the spell fails.
