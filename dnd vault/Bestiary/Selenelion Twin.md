## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** The Selenelion twins, Gleam and Glister, have advantage on saving throws against being charmed condition, and magic can't put them to sleep.

**Regeneration.** A Selenelion twin regains 5 hit points at the start of her turn as long as both twins are alive and within 60 feet of each other. A twin dies only if she starts her turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Twin Bond.** While both Selenelion twins are alive and on the same plane of existence, each is aware of the other's emotions.
