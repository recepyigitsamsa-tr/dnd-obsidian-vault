## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Strahd fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Master of the House.** When Strahd is reduced to 0 hit points, he dissolves into mist and immediately teleports to his lair in Castle Ravenloft. After {@dice 1d4} hours, Strahd re-forms in a random unoccupied space within his lair, regaining all his hit points.

**Regeneration.** Strahd regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 hit point. If he takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn.

**Spider Climb.** Strahd can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Vampire Weaknesses.** Strahd has the following flaws:

**Harmed by Running Water.** While in running water, Strahd takes 20 acid damage if he ends his turn there, and he can't use his Change Shape.

**Sunlight Hypersensitivity.** While in sunlight, Strahd takes 20 radiant damage at the start of his turn, has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can't use his Change Shape bonus action.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Death Strike | +9 to hit | 1d8 + 4 damage) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6 damage) necrotic | - |
| Blighted Fire {@recharge 5} | DC 18 | 4d6 damage) fire damage plus 14 (4d6 damage) necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much | - |
| Charm | DC 17 | - | - |

**Multiattack.** Strahd makes two Death Strike attacks. He can replace one of these attacks with Blighted Fire if available.

**Death Strike.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d8 + 4 damage) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6 damage) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, Strahd can forgo dealing slashing damage; the target then has the grappled condition condition (escape DC 18 Saving Throw) instead. Strahd can grapple only one creature at a time.

**Blighted Fire {@recharge 5}.** Strahd summons shadowy, necrotic fire that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point he can see within 90 feet of himself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6 damage) fire damage plus 14 (4d6 damage) necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Charm.** Strahd targets one Humanoid he can see within 30 feet of himself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or have the charmed condition condition. The charmed condition target regards Strahd as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. The target isn't under Strahd's control, but it takes Strahd's requests and actions in the most favorable way.

Each time Strahd or his companions deal damage to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Strahd is reduced to 0 hit points, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or uses a bonus action to end the effect.

## Legendary Actions

**Cunning Escape.** Strahd moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Strike (Costs 2 Actions).** Strahd makes one Death Strike attack.
