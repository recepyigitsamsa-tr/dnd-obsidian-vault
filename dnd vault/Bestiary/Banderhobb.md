**Bite.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}22 (5d6 + 5 damage) piercing damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 15 Saving Throw) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition, and the banderhobb can't use its bite attack or tongue attack on another target.

**Tongue.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pulled to a space within 5 feet of the banderhobb, which can use a bonus action to make a bite attack against the target.

**Swallow.** The banderhobb makes a bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed creature is blinded condition and restrained condition, it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside the banderhobb and it takes 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage at the start of each of the banderhobb's turns. A creature reduced to 0 hit points in this way stops taking necrotic damage and becomes stable.

The banderhobb can have only one target swallowed at a time. While the banderhobb isn't incapacitated condition, it can regurgitate the creature at any time (no action required) in a space within 5 feet of it. The creature exits prone condition. If the banderhobb dies, it likewise regurgitates a swallowed creature.

**Shadow Step.** The banderhobb magically teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space of dim light or darkness that it can see. Before or after teleporting, it can make a bite or tongue attack.
