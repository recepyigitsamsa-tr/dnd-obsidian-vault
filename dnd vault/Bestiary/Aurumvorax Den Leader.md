**Bite.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 (2d8 + 4 damage) piercing damage. If the target is a creature wearing armor of any type, the aurumvorax gains one of the following benefits of its choice:

**Frenzy.** The aurumvorax has advantage on attack rolls until start of its next turn.

**Invigorate.** The aurumvorax regains 6 ({@dice 1d8 + 2}) hit points.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 (2d6 + 4 damage) slashing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled condition (escape DC 14 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the aurumvorax can't use its Claw attack on another target, and when it moves, it can drag the grappled condition creature with it, without the aurumvorax's speed being halved.
