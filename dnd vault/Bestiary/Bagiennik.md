**Acid Spray.** The bagiennik sprays acid on one creature it can see within 30 feet of it, creating a puddle of oil beneath the creature. The target must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 18 (4d8 damage) acid damage and is knocked prone condition. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone condition. The slippery oil covers the ground in a 5-foot square centered on the point where the target was standing for 1 minute. A creature that enters the oily area or ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or fall prone condition.

**Healing Oil (3/Day).** The bagiennik applies healing oil to a creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target magically regains 7 {@dice 2d6} hp and is freed from any disease or poison. The target must then succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or its speed is halved and it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws for 1 minute.
