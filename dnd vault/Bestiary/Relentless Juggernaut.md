**Multiattack.** The juggernaut makes two attacks. It can replace one attack with Deadly Shaping if it is ready.

**Executioner's Pick.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}17 (2d10 + 6 damage) piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of the juggernaut's next turn.

**Fist.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 (1d10 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be knocked prone condition.

**Deadly Shaping {@recharge 5}.** The juggernaut magically shapes a feature of its surroundings into a deadly implement. A creature the juggernaut can see within 60 feet of it must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the targeted creature is struck by one of the following (juggernaut's choice):

**Flying Stone.** The target takes 22 (5d8 damage) bludgeoning damage and is incapacitated condition until the start of the juggernaut's next turn, and the implement vanishes.

**Scything Shrapnel.** The target takes 14 (4d6 damage) slashing damage, and the implement vanishes. At the start of each of its turns, the target takes 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage from the wound left by the shrapnel. The wound ends if the target regains any hit points or if a creature uses an action to stanch the wound, which requires a successful DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check.

## Legendary Actions

**Implacable Advance.** The juggernaut moves up to its speed, ignoring {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. Any object in its path takes 55 (10d10 damage) bludgeoning damage if it isn't being worn or carried.

**Rapid Shaping (Costs 3 Actions).** The juggernaut recharges Deadly Shaping and uses it.
