## Traits

**Creature Sense.** The elder brain is aware of creatures within 1 mile of itself that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each one's Intelligence score, but can't sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a mind blank spell spell, a nondetection spell spell, or similar magic can't be perceived in this manner.

**Magic Resistance.** The elder brain has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Telepathic Hub.** The elder brain can use its telepathy to initiate and maintain telepathic conversations with up to ten creatures at a time. The elder brain can let those creatures telepathically hear each other while connected in this way.
