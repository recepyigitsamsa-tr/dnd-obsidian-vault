**Bite.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 (1d6 + 2 damage) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6 damage) poison damage.

**Kiss.** The vargouille kisses one incapacitated condition humanoid within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw or become cursed. The cursed target loses 1 point of Charisma after each hour, as its head takes on fiendish aspects. The curse doesn't advance while the target is in sunlight or the area of a daylight spell spell; don't count that time. When the cursed target's Charisma becomes 2, it dies, and its head tears from its body and becomes a new vargouille. Casting remove curse spell, greater restoration spell, or a similar spell on the target before the transformation is complete can end the curse. Doing so undoes the changes made to the target by the curse.

**Stunning Shriek.** The vargouille shrieks. Each humanoid and beast within 30 feet of the vargouille and able to hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be frightened condition until the end of the vargouille's next turn. While frightened condition in this way, a target is stunned condition. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the Stunning Shriek of all vargouilles for 1 hour.
