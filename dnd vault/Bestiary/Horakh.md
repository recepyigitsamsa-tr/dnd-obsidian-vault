## Traits

**Implant Egg.** If the horakh reduces a creature to 0 hp with a Bite attack or as a bonus action while within 5 feet of a creature with 0 hp, the horakh can implant an egg in the creature. The implanted egg rests in the creature's eye socket for 14 days while it incubates. A host creature can carry only one horakh egg to term at a time. While the egg is implanted, the host can't use its eye and has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on sight. Exactly 24 hours before the egg hatches, the host becomes blinded condition. When the egg hatches, the young horakh erupts from the host's head, killing the host in the process.

A lesser restoration spell spell cast on the host destroys the egg. Alternatively, a creature other than the host can take an action to remove the egg by succeeding on a DC 16 Saving Throw Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check. On a failure, the host takes 9 (2d8 damage) slashing damage.

**Standing Leap.** The horakh's long jump is up to 30 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

If the horakh scores a critical hit, it removes one of the target's eyes, provided the target has eyes, and places the eye in a fluid sac on its thorax.
