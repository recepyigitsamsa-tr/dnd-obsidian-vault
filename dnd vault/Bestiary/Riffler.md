## Traits

**Card Sense.** The riffler can smell the presence of magical cards, including Decks of Many Things and other magical decks, within 1 mile of itself. It knows the direction to any such cards in that range. Effects that protect a target from divination magic block this sense.

**Riffling Step.** The riffler can burrow through any nonmagical material that isn't iron, shuffling the substance through which the riffler moves aside like cards to form a tunnel that closes behind the riffler.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Spectral Card | +6 to hit | 1d10 + 3 damage) force damage plus 5 (1d10 damage) | - |
| Card Spray {@recharge 5} | DC 14 | 5d10 damage) force | - |
| Plane Shift | - | - | - |

**Multiattack.** The riffler makes two Spectral Card attacks.

**Spectral Card.** {@atk ms,rs} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d10 + 3 damage) force damage plus 5 (1d10 damage) damage that is radiant if the {@dice d10} roll is an even number and necrotic if it's odd.

**Card Spray {@recharge 5}.** The riffler magically unleashes a spray of spectral cards in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (5d10 damage) force damage and has the restrained condition condition for 1 minute as cards bind it. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A restrained condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Plane Shift.** The riffler casts the Plane Shift spell spell targeting only itself, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability.

## Reactions

**Shuffle Destiny.** When a creature the riffler can see within 30 feet of itself makes an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw, the riffler can magically force that creature to roll a {@dice d6} and either add the number rolled to the total or subtract it from the total (riffler's choice), potentially changing the outcome.
