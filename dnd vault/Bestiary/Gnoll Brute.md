**Brute.** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the gnoll brute hits with it (included in the attacks).

**Charge.** If the gnoll brute moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, the target takes one extra die of the weapon's damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or fall prone condition.

**Instinctive.** The gnoll brute has advantage on initiative rolls and saving throws against being charmed condition or frightened condition. If surprised, the gnoll can still act normally on its first turn.
