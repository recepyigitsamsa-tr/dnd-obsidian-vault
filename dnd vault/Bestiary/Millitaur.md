**Poisonous Flask {@recharge 5}.** The millitaur hastily combines alchemical substances into a poisonous concoction and throws it at a point the millitaur can see within 30 feet. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6 damage) poison damage and is poisoned condition for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned condition. A poisoned condition creature can make a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Healing Tonic (2/Day).** The millitaur administers a healing tonic to a willing creature within 5 feet of it. The target magically regains 7 {@dice 2d6} hp and is freed from any disease or poison.
