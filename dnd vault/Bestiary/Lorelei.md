## Traits

**Alluring Presence.** When a Humanoid that can see the lorelei starts its turn within 30 feet of the lorelei, the lorelei can force it to make a DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw if the lorelei isn't incapacitated condition and can see the Humanoid. On a failed save, the Humanoid is charmed condition until the start if its next turn. While charmed condition, the target is incapacitated condition and must move on its turn toward the lorelei by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet of the lorelei for a kiss from her. The Humanoid doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage, the Humanoid can repeat the saving throw. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends for it, and it regains its senses for the remainder of its turn.

Unless surprised, a Humanoid can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the Humanoid does so, it can't see the lorelei until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the Humanoid looks at the lorelei in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

**Amphibious.** The lorelei can breathe air and water.

**Free Water Spirit.** While in contact with water, the lorelei ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce her speed or cause her to be restrained condition. In addition, she can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled condition.
