**Multiattack.** The fire starter makes two Havoc Hammer or Havoc Flask attacks.

**Havoc Hammer.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 (1d8 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8 damage) fire damage. If the target is a creature, magical flames cling to it, causing it to take 3 (1d6 damage) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. Immediately after taking this damage on its turn, the target can make a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

**Havoc Flask.** {@atk rw} +4 to hit to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. {@h}13 (2d12 damage) fire damage. If the target is a creature, magical flames cling to it, causing it to take 3 (1d6 damage) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. Immediately after taking this damage on its turn, the target can make a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

After the fire starter throws the flask, roll a {@dice d6}; on a 3 or lower, the fire starter has no more flasks to throw.
