**Acid Squirt.** {@atk rw} +5 to hit to hit, range 20/40 ft., one target. {@h}7 (1d8 + 3 damage) acid damage.

**Beer Shower.** The keg robot spews an unnaturally potent beer in a 15-foot cone or in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be poisoned condition. While poisoned condition in this way, a creature has its speed halved by exposure to the potent brew. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Additionally, the beer shower extinguishes any fires or open flames in its area.

**Hot Oil Spray {@recharge 5}.** The keg robot sprays hot oil in a 15-foot cone or in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7 (1d8 + 3 damage) fire damage and falls prone condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone condition.

Any creature affected by the hot oil spray that takes fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute) takes an additional 3 (1d6 damage) fire damage, and the oil burns away.

If the oil that remains in the area of the spray is lit, it burns for {@dice 1d4} rounds and deals 3 (1d6 damage) fire damage to any creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
