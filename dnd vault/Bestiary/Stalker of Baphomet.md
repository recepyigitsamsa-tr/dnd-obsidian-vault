**Rock.** {@atk rw} +11 to hit to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. {@h}23 (3d10 + 7 damage) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or have the prone condition condition. After the stalker throws the rock, roll a {@dice d6}; on a roll of 3 or lower, the stalker has no more rocks to throw.

**Erupting Horns {@recharge 5}.** The stalker causes the earth to churn at a point on the ground it can see within 60 feet of itself. Six horn-shaped stones erupt in a 30-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point and then crumble to dust.

Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 (6d10 damage) piercing damage and is pushed up to 30 feet upward and then falls. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.
