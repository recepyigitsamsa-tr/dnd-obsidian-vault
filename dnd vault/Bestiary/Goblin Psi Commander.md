**Multiattack.** The goblin makes three Psychic Blade attacks.

**Psychic Blade.** {@atk mw,rw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one creature. {@h}11 (2d6 + 4 damage) psychic damage, and the target must subtract {@dice 1d4} from the next attack roll or saving throw it makes before the end of the goblin's next turn.

**Synaptic Rend {@recharge 5}.** The goblin unleashes a 30-foot-radius sphere of psychic energy, centered on a point the goblin can see within 60 feet of itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6 damage) psychic damage and has the incapacitated condition condition until the end of the goblin's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

## Reactions

**Psionic Shield.** When the goblin or one of its allies within 15 feet of it is hit by an attack roll, the goblin conjures a shield of force. The target of the attack gains a +3 bonus to its AC against the triggering attack roll, potentially causing it to miss.
