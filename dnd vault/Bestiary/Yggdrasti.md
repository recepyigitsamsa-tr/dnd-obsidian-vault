## Traits

**Cavities.** The yggdrasti has {@dice 1d4 + 2} cavities in its trunk. Each cavity is big enough to hold one Medium creature, two Small creatures, or eight Tiny creatures. A creature inside a cavity has {@quickref Cover||3||three-quarters cover} against attacks and other effects that originate outside the cavity. The yggdrasti's cavities aren't connected to one another.

**False Appearance.** If the yggdrasti is motionless and rooted in the ground at the start of combat, it looks just like a dead tree and has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the rooted yggdrasti move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to discern that the yggdrasti is animate.

**Lightning Conduit.** If the yggdrasti is subjected to lightning damage, it is unhurt, and the lightning damage is instead divided evenly among all creatures it is grappling. In addition, the yggdrasti regains one use of Lightning Discharge.

**Unusual Nature.** The yggdrasti doesn't require air or sleep.
