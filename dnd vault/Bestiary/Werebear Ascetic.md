## Traits

**Shapechanger.** The werebear ascetic can use its action to polymorph into a bear-humanoid hybrid or into its kindred bear form, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, unless noted, are the same in each form. Any armor it is wearing merges into its alternate forms. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Kindred Form.** The werebear's kindred form takes the shape of a Large bear. While in this form, it can speak to and understand bears, cannot take any actions requiring hands, adds its Constitution modifier to the result of any saving throw, and gains 25 temporary hit points the first time it takes this form each day.
