## Traits

**False Appearance.** If Squirt is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll.

**Unusual Nature.** Squirt doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Slam | +4 to hit | 1d4 + 2 damage) bludgeoning | - |
| Boggle Oil (3 Applications) | DC 11 | - | - |

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}4 (1d4 + 2 damage) bludgeoning damage.

**Boggle Oil (3 Applications).** Squirt expends 1 application of boggle oil to create a 10-foot-square puddle of slippery, non-flammable oil on the ground within 5 feet of it. The puddle is {@quickref difficult terrain||3} and lasts for 1 hour. Each creature that enters the puddle's area or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 11 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or fall prone condition. Boggles are unaffected by the oil. After it expends all 3 applications, Squirt can't use this action again until its supply of boggle oil is replenished.
