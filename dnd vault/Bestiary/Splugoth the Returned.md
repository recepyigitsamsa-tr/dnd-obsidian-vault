**Word From Beyond (1/Day).** Splugoth remembers and repeats aloud a few words from a place he entered while walking back from the next world to this one. Each creature of his choice within 30 feet of him that can hear him must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be stunned condition until the end of its next turn.

## Reactions

**Absorb Attack.** When a creature Splugoth can see hits him with a melee weapon attack, the weapon snags on a pocket of residual resurrectional energy and is caught fast. The attack is negated and the weapon cannot be used until the creature succeeds on a DC 12 Saving Throw Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check as an action to pull it out of Splugoth. Natural weapons can have their attacks negated by this feature, but can then be retracted automatically at the end of the attacking creature's turn.
