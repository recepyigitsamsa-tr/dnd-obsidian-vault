**Poison Blade.** {@atk mw,rw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. {@h}7 (1d4 + 5 damage) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10 damage) poison damage.

**Beguiling Whisper.** The infiltrator magically whispers to a creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or have the stunned condition condition due to fear or delight (the infiltrator's choice) until the end of the target's next turn, after which the target is immune to this Beguiling Whisper for 24 hours.

## Legendary Actions

**Cunning.** The infiltrator escapes nonmagical restraints and ends the grappled condition condition on itself, then moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Stab (Costs 2 Actions).** The infiltrator makes one Poison Blade attack.

**Misdirecting Escape (Costs 3 Actions).** The infiltrator magically has the invisible condition condition and creates an illusory duplicate of itself in its space, then teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space within 15 feet of itself. The image flings illusory blades at two creatures of the infiltrator's choice within 20 feet of the image. Each target must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw, taking 13 (3d8 damage) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The invisibility lasts until the end of the infiltrator's next turn.


## Reactions

**Uncanny Dodge.** When an attacker the infiltrator can see hits the infiltrator with an attack, the infiltrator halves the attack's damage against it.
