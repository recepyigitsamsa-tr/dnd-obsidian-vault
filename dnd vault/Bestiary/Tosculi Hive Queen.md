**Multiattack.** The tosculi hive queen makes four Scimitar attacks.

**Scimitar.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}14 (2d6 + 7 damage) slashing damage.

**Stinger.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}22 (6d4 + 7 damage) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be poisoned condition for 1 minute. While poisoned condition in this way, the target is also paralyzed condition. A poisoned condition target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The hive queen's potent poison can be removed only by the greater restoration spell spell or similar magic.

**Implant Egg.** The hive queen implants an egg into an incapacitated condition creature within 5 feet of her that isn't a Construct or Undead. Until the egg hatches or is removed, the creature is poisoned condition, paralyzed condition, and doesn't need to eat or drink. The egg hatches after 30 days, and the larval tosculi bursts out of the host, killing the host in the process. A creature can take its action to remove the egg by succeeding on a DC 20 Saving Throw Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check. Alternatively, a spell or effect that cures disease disintegrates the unhatched tosculi.

## Legendary Actions

**Flight.** The hive queen flies up to half her flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Stinger (Costs 2 Actions).** The hive queen makes one Stinger attack.

**Glitter Dust (Costs 2 Actions).** The hive queen beats her wings and creates a cloud of glittering, golden particles. Each non-tosculi creature within 20 feet of her must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or be blinded condition until the end of its next turn.
