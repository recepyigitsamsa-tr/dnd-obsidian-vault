**Multiattack (Hybrid form only).** The wolfwere makes three attacks: one with its Bite and two with its Claws.

**Longsword (Humanoid form only).** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 (1d8 + 5 damage) slashing damage or 11 (1d10 + 6 damage) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Bite (Wolf or Hybrid form only).** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d6 + 5 damage) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be knocked prone condition.

**Claws (Hybrid form only).** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 (2d4 + 5 damage) slashing damage.

**Lethargic Song (Humanoid form only).** The wolfwere plays a magical melody on an instrument. Every Humanoid within 200 feet of the wolfwere that hears the melody must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be slowed for 10 minutes, as if the slow spell spell has been cast on them. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it. A target that successfully saves is immune to this wolfwere's melody for the next 24 hours.

**Change Shape.** The wolfwere polymorphs into a wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a Humanoid (elf or human), or back into its true form, which is a dire wolf. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
