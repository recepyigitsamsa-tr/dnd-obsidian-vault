**Constrict.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature. {@h}The target takes 11 (2d6 + 4 damage) bludgeoning damage, and it is grappled condition (escape DC 14 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition, and it takes 21 (6d6 damage) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The vine can constrict only one target at a time.

**Entangling Vines.** The assassin vine can animate normal vines and roots on the ground in a 15-foot square within 30 feet of it. These plants turn the ground in that area into {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. A creature in that area when the effect begins must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be restrained condition by entangling vines and roots. A creature restrained condition by the plants can use its action to make a DC 13 Saving Throw Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check, freeing itself on a successful check. The effect ends after 1 minute or when the assassin vine dies or uses Entangling Vines again.
