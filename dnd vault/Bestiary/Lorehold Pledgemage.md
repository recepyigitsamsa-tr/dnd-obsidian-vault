**Multiattack.** The pledgemage makes two Scroll Bash attacks.

**Scroll Bash.** {@atk ms} +5 to hit to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d10 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8 damage) thunder damage.

**Reduce to Memory {@recharge 5}.** Thundering golden energy erupts around a creature the pledgemage can see within 90 feet of it. The creature must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10 damage) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Construct has disadvantage on the saving throw.

## Reactions

**Learn from the Past (2/Day).** When another creature within 60 feet of the pledgemage misses a target with an attack roll, the pledgemage magically enables the attacker to reroll the attack roll. It must use the new roll.
