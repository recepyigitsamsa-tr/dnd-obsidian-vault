## Traits

**False Appearance.** If the mirror shade is within 5 feet of a reflective surface—such as a mirror, glass pane, or still water—it has advantage on its initiative roll. If a creature hasn't observed the mirror shade move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to discern that the mirror shade isn't the creature's own reflection.

**Mirror Movement.** The mirror shade can move along the surface of reflective or translucent objects, such as mirrors, without provoking opportunity attacks. It can move through translucent objects as if they were difficult terrain.

**Reflect Fear.** The mirror shade targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of itself and projects an illusion of that creature's greatest fear. The target must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw.

On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.
