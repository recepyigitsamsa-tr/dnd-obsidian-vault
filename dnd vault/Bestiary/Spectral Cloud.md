## Traits

**Blurred Form.** Attack rolls against the spectral cloud are made with disadvantage unless the attacker is within 15 feet of the spectral cloud or the spectral cloud is incapacitated condition.

**Incorporeal Movement.** The spectral cloud can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10 damage) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Spectral Touch | +12 to hit | 3d8 + 7 damage) force damage plus 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic | - |
| Chilling Winds {@recharge 5} | DC 20 | 7d10 damage) cold | - |

**Multiattack.** The spectral cloud makes two Spectral Touch attacks.

**Spectral Touch.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}20 (3d8 + 7 damage) force damage plus 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

A Humanoid slain by this attack immediately rises as a miniature spectral cloud (use the specter stat block in the Monster Manual). The miniature spectral cloud acts as an ally of its creator but isn't under its control.

**Chilling Winds {@recharge 5}.** The spectral cloud emits intensely cold wind in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 38 (7d10 damage) cold damage and has the incapacitated condition condition for 1 minute. The affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, that creature is immune to this spectral cloud's Chilling Winds for the next 24 hours.
