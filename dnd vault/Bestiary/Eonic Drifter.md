**Time-Warping Staff.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 (1d6 + 2 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6 damage) force damage.

**Drift Forward {@recharge 5}.** The drifter chooses one creature it can see within 5 feet of its future self. The target must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 7 (2d6 damage) psychic damage and is pulled forward in time. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn't pulled forward in time. A target pulled forward in time disappears, along with the drifter's future self, as the future self pulls the target with it. At the end of the drifter's next turn, the target and the drifter's future self reappear in the spaces they previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied spaces. When the target reappears, it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn as it recovers from the disorienting experience.
