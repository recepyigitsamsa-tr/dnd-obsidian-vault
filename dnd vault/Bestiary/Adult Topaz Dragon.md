**Claw.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d8 + 4 damage) slashing damage.

**Desiccating Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales yellowish necrotic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 35 (10d6 damage) necrotic damage and is weakened until the end of its next turn. A weakened creature has disadvantage on Strength-based ability checks and Strength saving throws, and the creature's weapon attacks that rely on Strength deal half damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't weakened.

**Psionics (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon uses Psychic Step or Spellcasting.

**Essential Reduction (Costs 3 Actions).** The dragon targets a creature or an object not being worn or carried that it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 28 (8d6 damage) necrotic damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it crumbles to dust.
