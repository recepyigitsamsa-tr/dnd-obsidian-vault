## Traits

**Air Hatred.** The al-aeshma has advantage on attack rolls against creatures that are flying.

**Earth Bound.** The al-aeshma is anchored to the earth and can't fly far from it. The al-aeshma can't willingly fly more than 30 feet above the ground. If it starts its turn more than 30 feet away from the ground, it loses its damage immunities and is vulnerable to lightning and thunder damage until it starts its turn within 30 feet of the ground.

**Elemental Demise.** When an al-aeshma dies, its body disintegrates into a swirling spray of coarse sand, leaving behind only equipment it was wearing or carrying.

**Regeneration.** The al-aeshma regains 10 hp at the start of its turn. If it takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the al-Aeshma's next turn. The alâ€‘aeshma dies only if it starts its turn at 0 hp and doesn't regenerate.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Scimitar | +9 to hit | 2d6 + 5 damage) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) necrotic | - |

**Multiattack.** The al-aeshma makes three Scimitar attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Dust Devil or Spellcasting.

**Scimitar.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d6 + 5 damage) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) necrotic damage.

**Dust Devil.** The al-aeshma creates a swirling dust devil centered on a point it can see within 120 feet of it. The dust devil appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 30 feet tall with a 5-foot radius. Each creature in the area and each creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be restrained condition. While restrained condition, a creature takes 7 (2d6 damage) slashing damage and 7 (2d6 damage) necrotic damage at the start of each of the al-aeshma's turns. A creature, including a restrained condition creature, can take an action to free the restrained condition creature by succeeding on a DC 17 Saving Throw Strength check.

The al-aeshma can use a bonus action on its turn to move the dust devil up to 30 feet. A restrained condition creature doesn't move with the dust devil when the dust devil moves and is freed if the dust devil moves out of its space. The dust devil lasts until the al-aeshma loses its {@status concentration} (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell), and the alaeshma can have only one dust devil active at a time.
