**Avoidance.** If the null is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take half as much damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and half as much damage if it fails.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Force Dagger | +6 to hit | 1d4 + 3 damage) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8 damage) force | - |

**Multiattack.** The null makes two Force Dagger attacks.

**Force Dagger.** {@atk mw,rw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}5 (1d4 + 3 damage) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8 damage) force damage. {@hom}The dagger magically returns to the null's hand immediately after a ranged attack.

## Reactions

**Nullify Spell (3/Day).** The null utters a magical word of cancelation to interrupt a creature it can see that is casting a spell. If the spell is 3rd level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If the spell is 4th level or higher, the null makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 Saving Throw + the spell's level). On a successful check, the spell fails and has no effect.
