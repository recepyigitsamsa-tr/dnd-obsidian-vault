## Traits

**Chaos Mutations.** At the start of each of its turns, the rift swine's body experiences a mutation. Choose an option or roll a {@dice d6} to determine the type of mutation. The mutation lasts until the start of the rift swine's next turn.

**1 Acid Boils.** The next creature that hits the rift swine with a melee attack while within 5 feet of the rift swine takes 3 (1d6 damage) acid damage.

**2 Acid Saliva.** The next melee attack the rift swine makes that hits a creature deals an extra 3 (1d6 damage) acid damage to the creature.

**3 Extra Eyes.** The rift swine has advantage on the next attack roll it makes.

**4 Extra Hooves.** The rift swine's speed increases by 10 feet, and the rift swine doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it moves out of an enemy's reach.

**5 Second Heart.** The rift swine gains 10 {@dice 3d6} temporary hp.

**6 Toughened Hide.** The rift swine has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (the rift swine's choice).

**Dozens of Eyes.** The rift swine has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on sight and on saving throws against being blinded condition. In addition, if the rift swine isn't blinded condition, creatures attacking it can't benefit from traits and features that rely on a creature's allies distracting or surrounding the rift swine, such as the Pack Tactics trait or Sneak Attack class feature.
