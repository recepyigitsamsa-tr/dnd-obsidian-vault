**Admit Entity {@recharge 5}.** The exorcist thins the veil of death for a creature it can see within 60 feet of itself, exposing the target to malevolent entities. The target must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 36 (8d8 damage) psychic damage and has the incapacitated condition condition for 1 minute, during which time it retches and babbles incoherently in a voice that is not its own. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. An incapacitated condition target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
