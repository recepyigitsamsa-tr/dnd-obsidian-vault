**Magic Resistance.** The maelephant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Multiattack.** The maelephant makes two attacks using its Claw, Trunk, or a combination of the two.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}17 (2d10 + 6 damage) slashing damage.

**Trunk.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 (3d6 + 6 damage) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the grappled condition condition (escape DC 18 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target has the restrained condition condition. While it is grappling a creature, the maelephant can't use its Trunk attack against other creatures.

**Noxious Breath {@recharge 5}.** The maelephant releases a cloud of noxious gas. All creatures in a 30-foot cone in front of the maelephant must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. Targets take 42 (12d6 damage) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, on a failed save, the creature's Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The creature can't cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them. A feebled creature can repeat the save every minute, ending the effect on a success.

## Reactions

**Defensive Stance.** As a reaction to taking damage, the maelephant enters a defensive stance until the end of its next turn. While in a defensive stance, the maelephant moves at half speed and can't take bonus actions, but its AC increases by 5.
