## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Spiked Glaive | +9 to hit | 1d10 + 5 damage) piercing or slashing | - |
| Serrated Bolt | +7 to hit | 3d6 + 3 damage) piercing | - |

**Multiattack.** Glaive makes two Spiked Glaive attacks and two Serrated Bolt attacks.

**Spiked Glaive.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}10 (1d10 + 5 damage) piercing or slashing damage, or 14 (1d10 + 9 damage) piercing or slashing damage if Glaive is in overdrive.

**Serrated Bolt.** {@atk rw} +7 to hit to hit, range 60 ft., one target. {@h}13 (3d6 + 3 damage) piercing damage. If Glaive has advantage on the attack roll, the serrated bolt lodges in the target, and the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the serrated bolt is removed. A target's speed can be reduced by only one serrated bolt at a time. A creature can use its action to remove a serrated bolt lodged in itself or another creature within its reach; when the bolt is removed from a creature, that creature takes 5 (2d4 damage) slashing damage.

## Reactions

**Self-Preservation.** In response to being hit by a weapon attack, Glaive reduces the damage by 11 ({@dice 2d10}).
