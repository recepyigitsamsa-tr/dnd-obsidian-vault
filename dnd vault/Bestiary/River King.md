**Multiattack.** The River King makes two Longsword or Flood Blast attacks.

**Longsword.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 (1d8 + 5 damage) slashing damage, or 10 (1d10 + 5 damage) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 10 (3d6 damage) poison damage.

**Flood Blast.** {@atk rs} +8 to hit to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}21 (4d8 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 30 feet away from the River King and knocked prone condition.

**Grasping Whirlpool {@recharge 5}.** The River King magically creates a swirling vortex of water centered on a point he can see within 60 feet. The vortex appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 15 feet tall with a 10-foot radius. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 36 (8d8 damage) bludgeoning damage and is restrained condition. On a success, a creature takes half the damage, isn't restrained condition, and can choose to be pushed out of the whirlpool's space. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. While restrained condition, a creature is unable to breathe unless it can breathe water, and it must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Strength saving throw at the end of each of its turns or take 18 (4d8 damage) bludgeoning damage. A creature, including the restrained condition creature, can take an action to free the restrained condition creature by succeeding on a DC 18 Saving Throw Strength check. A creature with a swimming speed has advantage on the saving throw and on the Strength check to escape.

## Legendary Actions

**Attack.** The River King makes a Longsword or Flood Blast attack.

**Flow.** The River King moves up to his walking speed, or swims up to half his swimming speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Ripple (Costs 2 Actions).** The River King magically ripples like sunlight on the surface of water. Until the start of his next turn, attack rolls against him have disadvantage.


## Reactions

**Blade Current.** When a creature within 5 feet of the River King stands up from prone condition, he can make one Longsword attack against that creature.
