## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Devorastus fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Ooze Cube.** Devorastus takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have {@quickref Cover||3||total cover}. A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC 21 Saving Throw Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 35 (10d6 damage) acid damage. The cube can hold only one Huge creature or up to six Large or smaller creatures inside it at a time.

**Sticky.** Devorastus can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Transparent.** Even when Devorastus is in plain sight, it takes a successful DC 15 Saving Throw Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to spot Devorastus if it has neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter Devorastus' space while unaware of Devorastus is surprised by it.

**Multiattack.** Devorastus makes four attacks using its Pseudopod, Spit, or a combination of the two.

**Pseudopod.** {@atk mw} +13 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}42 (12d6 damage) acid damage.

**Spit.** {@atk rw} +8 to hit to hit, range 100/200 ft., one target. {@h}28 (8d6 damage) acid damage. A target hit by this attack must make a DC 21 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the prone condition condition.

**Engulf.** Devorastus moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever Devorastus enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC 21 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of Devorastus. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. On a failed save, Devorastus enters the creature's space, the creature takes 35 (10d6 damage) acid damage, and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, has the restrained condition condition, and takes 42 (12d6 damage) acid damage at the start of each of Devorastus' turns. When Devorastus moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by making a DC 21 Saving Throw Strength check as an action. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of Devorastus.
