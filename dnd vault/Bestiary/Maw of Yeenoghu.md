**Gorging Charge {@recharge 5}.** The maw moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks and can move through the spaces of Large or smaller creatures. Each time the maw enters a creature's space for the first time during this move, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or take 25 (3d12 + 6 damage) piercing damage and have the grappled condition condition (escape DC 16 Saving Throw); if a creature is already grappled condition this way, it has the prone condition condition. Until this grapple ends, the target has the restrained condition condition. The maw can have only one creature grappled condition in this way at a time.

## Reactions

**Fanged Rebuke.** In response to taking damage, the maw makes one Bite attack against a random creature within 10 feet of itself. If no creature is within reach, the maw can make two Fang Fling attacks.
