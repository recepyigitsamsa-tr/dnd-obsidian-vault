**Multiattack.** The dau makes two Slam attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}6 (1d6 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6 damage) necrotic damage, and the dau regains hp equal to the necrotic damage dealt. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The creature dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.

## Reactions

**Mirror Dodge.** When a creature the dau can see within 30 feet of it attacks the dau or targets it with a spell, the dau replaces itself with an illusory duplicate and teleports to any unoccupied space that it can see within 30 feet. The dau isn't affected by the attack or spell, and the illusory duplicate is destroyed.

**Tangible Illusion (1/Day).** When the dau casts a spell that creates an illusion of an object, the dau temporarily transforms that illusion into a physical, nonmagical object. The temporary object lasts 10 minutes, after which it reverts to being an illusion (or vanishes, if the duration of the original illusion expires). During that time, the illusion has all the physical properties of the object it represents, but it doesn't have any of the object's magical properties. The dau must touch the illusion to trigger this transformation, and the object can be no larger than 5 cubic feet.
