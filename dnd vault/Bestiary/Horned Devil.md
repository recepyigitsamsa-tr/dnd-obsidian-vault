**Tail.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}10 (1d8 + 6 damage) piercing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or lose 10 ({@dice 3d6}) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 10 (3d6 damage). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 Saving Throw Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.
