## Traits

**Blaze Rod.** When the blaze drops to 0 hit points, it disappears in a cloud of smoke and has a 50 percent chance of leaving behind a glowing rod worth 100 gp. The rod sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. As an action, a creature can try to snap the rod, doing so with a successful DC 14 Saving Throw Strength check. The snapped rod releases its fiery energy in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 6 (1d12 damage) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Heat Aura.** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the blaze takes 3 (1d6 damage) fire damage.

**Illumination.** The blaze sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

**Water Susceptibility.** The blaze takes 1 cold damage for every 5 feet it moves in water, for every gallon of water splashed on it, or whenever it starts its turn in the rain.
