**Multiattack.** The anubian makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 (1d6 + 3 damage) slashing damage.

**Haboob (1/Day).** A 30-foot-tall cylinder of sand forms in the anubian's space and moves with it for 10 minutes, until the anubian ends the storm as a bonus action, or until its {@status concentration} ends (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). The area within 5 feet of the anubian is heavily obscured. A creature that starts its turn in that area or enters the area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or be restrained condition by the storm. While restrained condition, the creature takes 3 (1d6 damage) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns, and moves with the anubian when the anubian moves. A creature, including the restrained condition creature, can use its action to free the restrained condition creature by succeeding on a DC 13 Saving Throw Strength check.
