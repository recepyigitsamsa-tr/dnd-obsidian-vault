**Multiattack.** The vampire makes three melee attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled condition by the vampire, incapacitated condition, or restrained condition. {@h}7 (1d6 + 4 damage) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) necrotic damage. If the target is humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw or be charmed condition by the vampire for 1 minute. While charmed condition in this way, the target is infatuated with the vampire. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

**Rapier.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d8 + 4 damage) piercing damage.

**Unarmed Strike.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 (1d8 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage. The vampire can also grapple the target (escape DC 14 Saving Throw) if it is a creature and the vampire has a hand free.

## Reactions

**Parry.** The vampire adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the vampire must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
