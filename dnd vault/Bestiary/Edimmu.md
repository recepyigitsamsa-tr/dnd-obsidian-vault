## Traits

**Incorporeal Movement.** The edimmu can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10 damage) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Rejuvenation.** If destroyed, an edimmu rises again in {@dice 2d4} days, regaining all its hp and becoming active again. When the edimmu rises, it appears within 5 feet of its remains. Only burying its mortal remains in consecrated or hallowed ground prevents this trait from functioning.

**Undead Nature.** The edimmu doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Water Siphon.** The edimmu has advantage on attack rolls against creatures made of or gaining power from magical water, such as water elementals, water jinnborn, water genies, and sorcerers with water-based origins. In addition, such creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw against the edimmu's Draining Touch and Multiattack.

**Multiattack.** The edimmu makes two Draining Touch attacks. If both attacks hit one creature that isn't a Construct or Undead, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion condition. A creature that fails this saving throw by 5 or more is also stunned condition until the end of its next turn.

**Draining Touch.** {@atk ms} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}13 (2d8 + 4 damage) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after drinking 1 pint of water. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
