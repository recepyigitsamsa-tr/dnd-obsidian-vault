If the frostveil moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The frostveil can have only one creature engulfed at a time.

**Spirit Spores {@recharge}.** The frostveil releases a puff of psychotropic spores around itself. Each creature within 10 feet of the frostveil must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6 damage) cold damage and is incapacitated condition for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't incapacitated condition. When an incapacitated condition creature moves, it moves in a random direction. An incapacitated condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
