**Multiattack.** The seraph makes three attacks.

**Scimitar.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d6 + 5 damage) slashing damage, or 8 (1d6 + 5 damage) slashing damage in Small or Medium form, and 18 (4d8 damage) radiant damage.

**Change Shape.** The seraph magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium humanoid, into a Large giant, or back into its true form. Other than its size, its statistics are the same in each form. It's clothing and scimitars change size to match its new form. If the seraph dies, it reverts to its true form, and its equipment to its normal size.

**Voice of Avarice.** The seraph presents objects of desire, which can be illusions the seraph creates, to creatures of its choice. If those creatures are within 60 feet of the seraph, able to see it and the desirable objects, and able to hear the seraph, the creatures must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or become charmed condition by the seraph until the seraph is incapacitated condition or fails to use a bonus action on its turn to continue to present and speak about the desirable objects.

While charmed condition in this way, a target can take no reactions and can use its action only to Dash. If the charmed condition target is more than 5 feet from the seraph, the target must move as far as it can toward the seraph, trying to come within 5 feet. The target avoids obvious danger, including opportunity attacks. If the target can't avoid such danger, the target can repeat the saving throw before entering the dangerous area. While an affected creature is within 5 feet of the seraph, the creature can't take reactions and spends its turns staring at the desirable objects.

The target also repeats the saving throw if the target is subjected to a harmful effect, if the target can't see or hear the seraph, and at the end of each of the target's turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends for it. A target that successfully saves is immune to the Voice of Avarice of this seraph or any lesser seraph for the next 24 hours.
