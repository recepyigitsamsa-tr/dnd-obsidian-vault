## Reactions

**Tail Ray.** When the absorber takes damage from a spell, the absorber takes only half the triggering damage. If the spellcaster is within 60 feet of the absorber, the absorber can force the caster to make a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the caster takes the other half of the damage.
