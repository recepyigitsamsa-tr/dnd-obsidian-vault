**Bite.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}14 (2d8 + 5 damage) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8 damage) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on saving throws against the frightened condition condition. This curse lasts until removed by the Remove Curse spell spell or other magic.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d6 + 5 damage) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8 damage) necrotic damage.

**Phantom Deathwolf {@recharge 5}.** The deathwolf creates a terrifying phantom of itself in the mind of a creature the deathwolf can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Intelligence saving throw or have the frightened condition condition for 1 minute.

While the target is frightened condition, the phantom deals 21 (6d6 damage) psychic damage to the target at the start of each of the target's turns. A frightened condition target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Reactions

**Imposing Slash.** When a creature within 5 feet of the deathwolf makes an attack roll against it, the deathwolf forces the creature to succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on that roll. After the attack hits or misses, the deathwolf makes one Claw attack against the creature.

**Phase Step.** Immediately after taking damage, the deathwolf teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see that is in dim light or darkness.
