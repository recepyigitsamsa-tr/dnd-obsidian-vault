## Traits

**Distortion Gaze.** Those who meet the gaze of the fear smith experience the world seeming to twist at unnatural angles beneath their feet. When a creature that can see the fear smith's eye starts its turn within 30 feet of the fear smith, the fear smith can force the creature to make a DC 16 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw if the fear smith isn't incapacitated condition and can see the creature. On a failed save, the creature is disoriented until the start of its next turn. While disoriented, a creature can't take the Dash or Disengage action, and when it moves for the first time on its turn, it must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or fall prone condition.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the fear smith until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the fear smith in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

**Hidden Eye.** The fear smith has advantage on saving throws against being blinded condition.

**Magic Resistance.** The fear smith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
