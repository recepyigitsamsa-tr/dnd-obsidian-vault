**Multiattack.** The otyugh makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its tentacles.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 (2d8 + 3 damage) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned condition until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 ({@dice 1d10}) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

**Tentacle.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}7 (1d8 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8 damage) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled condition (escape DC 13 Saving Throw) and restrained condition until the grapple ends. The otyugh has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Tentacle Slam.** The otyugh slams creatures grappled condition by it into each other or a solid surface. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 10 (2d6 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage and be stunned condition until the end of the otyugh's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't stunned condition.
