## Traits

**Cloak of Swarms.** Akyishigal emits a cloud of flying, stinging insects from his mouth, eyes, and tears in his skin that spreads out in a 5-foot radius from him. At the start of each of his turns, Akyishigal chooses whether this cloak is active.

While this cloak is active, Akyishigal has disadvantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks, and creatures attacking Akyishigal can't benefit from traits and features that rely on a creature's allies distracting or surrounding the demon, such as the Pack Tactics trait or Sneak Attack feature. In addition, each creature that isn't a Construct or Undead that starts its turn in the cloud takes 11 (2d10 damage) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6 damage) poison damage and become poisoned condition for 1 hour. While poisoned condition in this way, a creature emits a stench of decomposition, and uncontrolled insects attack that creature in preference to other targets.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Akyishigal fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Akyishigal has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
