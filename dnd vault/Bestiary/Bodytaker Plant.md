**Multiattack.** The plant makes three Vine Lash attacks.

**Vine Lash.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}11 (2d6 + 4 damage) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled condition (escape DC 15 Saving Throw). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained condition. The plant has four vines, each of which can grapple one target.

**Entrapping Pod.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature grappled condition by the plant. {@h}22 (4d8 + 4 damage) acid damage, and the target is pulled into the plant's space and enveloped by the pod, and the grapple ends. While enveloped, the target is restrained condition, and it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and effects originating outside the pod. The enveloped target must also immediately succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or be stunned condition by the plant's sapping enzymes until it is removed from the pod or the plant dies. The enveloped target doesn't require air and gains 1 level of exhaustion condition for each hour it spends in the pod. If the target dies while enveloped, it immediately emerges from the pod as a living podling, wearing or carrying all of the original creature's equipment.

As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the bodytaker plant that is outside the pod can open the pod and pull the target free with a successful DC 15 Saving Throw Strength check. If the plant dies, the target is no longer restrained condition and can escape from the pod by spending 10 feet of movement, exiting prone condition. The plant has one pod, which can envelop one creature at a time.
