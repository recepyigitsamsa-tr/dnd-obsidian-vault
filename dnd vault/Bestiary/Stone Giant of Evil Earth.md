**Multiattack.** The giant makes two Thundering Stone Club or Boulder attacks in any combination.

**Thundering Stone Club.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}16 (3d6 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage. The giant can cause the club to emit a burst of thunderous energy that deals 10 (3d6 damage) thunder damage to each creature, other than the giant, within 30 feet of the target. The club can emit a burst this way only once per turn.

**Boulder.** {@atk rw} +10 to hit to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. {@h}19 (3d8 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or have the prone condition condition. After the giant throws the boulder, roll a {@dice d6}; on a roll of 3 or lower, the giant has no more boulders to throw.

## Reactions

**Unyielding.** In response to failing a saving throw to avoid being moved, having the prone condition condition, or both, the giant succeeds instead.
