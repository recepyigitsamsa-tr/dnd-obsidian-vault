## Traits

**Arctic Hunter.** The beli has advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks made to hide in snowy terrain. In addition, it has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on sight in snowy terrain.

**Cold Regeneration.** If it starts its turn in an area with below freezing temperature, the beli regains 3 hp. If the beli takes fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the beli's next turn. The beli dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and it doesn't regenerate.

**Flyby.** The beli doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Ice Dagger.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 (1d4 + 3 damage) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4 damage) cold damage.

**Icy Shortbow.** {@atk rw} +5 to hit to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. {@h}6 (1d6 + 3 damage) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4 damage) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion condition from the arrow's icy chill. On a success, the target can't suffer further levels of exhaustion condition from any beli's Icy Shortbow for 24 hours. If a creature would suffer a sixth level of exhaustion condition from this attack, it is reduced to 0 hp instead and must make death saving throws as normal. A creature reduced to 0 hp in this way can't suffer further levels of exhaustion condition from any beli's Icy Shortbow for 24 hours.

**Invisibility.** The beli magically turns invisible condition until it attacks or until its {@status concentration} ends (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell). Any equipment the beli wears or carries is invisible condition with it.
