## Traits

**Flood Fever.** During flood season, the subek is overcome with bloodthirsty malice, becoming more aggressive and losing its proficiency in Intelligence ({@skill History}) and Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) checks. If it hasn't fed within the past 8 hours, it enters a frenzy, spending each turn attacking the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the subek attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. During the frenzy, it has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hp. It continues the frenzy until it has fed and enters the frenzy again every time it goes without eating for 8 hours for the duration of the flood season.

**Hold Breath.** The subek can hold its breath for 15 minutes.
