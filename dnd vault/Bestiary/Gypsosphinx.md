## Traits

**Death Sense.** The sphinx can pinpoint, by scent, the location of each creature below half its hp maximum within 60 feet of it, and it can sense the general direction of creatures that don't have all of their hp within 1 mile of it. In addition, the sphinx can foretell the age and manner of a creature's death by looking at it. This effect doesn't take into account possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of powerful spells or the creature making a radical change in its life's path.

**Inscrutable.** The sphinx is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as any divination spell that it refuses. Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) checks made to ascertain the sphinx's intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.

**Magic Weapons.** The sphinx's weapon attacks are magical.
