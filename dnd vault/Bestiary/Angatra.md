## Traits

**Agonizing Gaze.** When a creature that can see the angatra's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the angatra, the angatra can force it to make a DC 13 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw if the angatra isn't incapacitated condition and can see the creature. On a failed saving throw, the creature's pain threshold lowers, and it becomes vulnerable to all damage types until the end of its next turn.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the angatra until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the angatra in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
