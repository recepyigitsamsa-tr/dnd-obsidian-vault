**Healing Touch (4/Day).** The valkyrie touches another creature. The target magically regains 21 {@dice 6d6} hp and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.

## Reactions

**Ascension.** When a friendly creature the valkyrie can see and within its Aura of Valor is reduced to 0 hp while engaged in melee combat, the valkyrie can reincarnate the creature as a gladiator. If the gladiator reduces at least three creatures to 0 hp within 1 minute of its reincarnation, it transforms into an einherjar. The valkyrie can provide ascension to up to two creatures each hour with this reaction.
