## Traits

**Blood Rune.** The fomorian has a blood rune inscribed on an effigy or some other object in its possession. While holding or wearing the object bearing the rune, the giant can use its Corrupting Hex action and Poisoning Rebuke reaction.

The object bearing the blood rune has AC 15; 30 hit points; and immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The object regains all its hit points at the end of every turn, but it turns to dust if reduced to 0 hit points or when the fomorian dies. If the rune is destroyed, the fomorian can inscribe a blood rune on an object in its possession when it finishes a short or long rest.

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the fomorian's darkvision.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the fomorian fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Greatclub | +10 to hit | 3d8 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) necrotic | - |
| Corrupting Hex (Requires Blood Rune) | DC 16 | 6d8 damage) necrotic | - |
| Eldritch Burst | DC 16 | 5d12 damage) force | - |

**Multiattack.** The fomorian makes three Greatclub attacks. If the fomorian has its blood rune, it can replace one of these attacks with a use of Corrupting Hex.

**Greatclub.** {@atk mw} +10 to hit to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}19 (3d8 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) necrotic damage.

**Corrupting Hex (Requires Blood Rune).** The fomorian targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw or take 27 (6d8 damage) necrotic damage and become cursed for 24 hours. While cursed this way, the target's speed is reduced by half, and if it tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Intelligence check or the spell fails and is wasted.

**Eldritch Burst.** Magical energy explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the fomorian can see within 120 feet of itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 32 (5d12 damage) force damage and has the prone condition condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

## Reactions

**Poisoning Rebuke (Requires Blood Rune).** In response to being damaged by a creature the fomorian can see within 60 feet of itself, the fomorian forces that creature to make a DC 16 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw; on a failed save, the creature has the poisoned condition condition until the end of its next turn.
