## Traits

**Lightning Affinity.** When Eo uses Spellcasting to cast a spell that deals lightning damage, that spell deals an additional 5 damage. When Eo casts a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, she can change that damage type to lightning: acid, cold, fire, poison, thunder.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Twinned Orbs | +9 to hit | 5d8 + 5 | - |
| Twinned Spell | - | - | - |
| Discharge (1/Day) | DC 17 | 14d6 + 40 damage) force | - |

**Twinned Orbs.** {@atk ms,rs} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 90 ft., two targets. {@h}27 (5d8 + 5 damage) acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison or thunder damage (Eo's choice).

**Twinned Spell.** Eo uses Spellcasting to cast banishment spell, dominate person, finger of death, or power word stun. This spell targets a second creature in range.

**Discharge (1/Day).** Eo emits a thin green ray at a creature within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save the target takes 89 (14d6 + 40 damage) force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell spell.

## Reactions

**Shocking Rebuke.** As a reaction to taking damage, Eo surrounds her attacker with a coil of lightning. The target must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. It takes 16 (2d10 + 5 damage) lightning damage on a failed save, half as much damage on a successful one.
