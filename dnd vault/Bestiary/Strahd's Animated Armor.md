## Traits

**Constructed Nature.** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

**Antimagic Susceptibility.** The armor is incapacitated condition while in the area of an antimagic field spell. If targeted by dispel magic spell, the armor must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious condition for 1 minute.

**False Appearance.** While the armor remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal suit of armor.
