**Awakening of the Scion.** The cradle is a container for the scion of Thrym|BGG. When the cradle drops to 0 hit points, its body shatters into shards of ice. The scion instantly appears in the space the cradle occupied and uses the cradle's initiative count.

**Magic Resistance.** The cradle has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster.** The cradle deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The cradle makes two Slam or Hurl Icicle attacks.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +15 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}30 (4d10 + 8 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (2d10 damage) cold damage.

**Hurl Icicle.** {@atk rw} +15 to hit to hit, range 120 ft., one target. {@h}26 (4d8 + 8 damage) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8 damage) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 23 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or have the prone condition condition.

**Freezing Breath {@recharge 5}.** The cradle exhales a blast of frost in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 52 (8d12 damage) cold damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. If this damage would reduce the target to 0 hit points, the target drops to 1 hit point instead and has the petrified condition condition, turning into a frozen statue.

If the statue takes bludgeoning damage, it shatters, killing the frozen creature. If the statue would take fire damage, it instead takes no damage and thaws, ending the petrification.
