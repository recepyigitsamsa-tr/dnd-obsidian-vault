**Constrict.** {@atk mw} +4 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}9 (2d6 + 2 damage) bludgeoning damage, and a Large or smaller target is grappled condition (escape DC 12 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition, and the blight can't constrict another target.

**Entangling Plants {@recharge 5}.** Grasping roots and vines sprout in a 15-foot radius centered on the blight, withering away after 1 minute. For the duration, that area is {@quickref difficult terrain||3} for nonplant creatures. In addition, each creature of the blight's choice in that area when the plants appear must succeed on a DC 12 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or become restrained condition. A creature can use its action to make a DC 12 Saving Throw Strength check, freeing itself or another entangled creature within reach on a success.
