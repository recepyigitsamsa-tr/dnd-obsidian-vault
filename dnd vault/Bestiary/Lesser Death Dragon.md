**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}14 (2d8 + 5 damage) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8 damage) necrotic damage.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft. one target. {@h}8 (1d6 + 5 damage) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled condition (escape DC 15 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition. The dragon has two claws, each of which can grapple one target.

**Cataclysmic Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a wave of ghostly purple flames in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8 damage) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature dies if the breath reduces it to 0 hit points. Additionally, any Medium or smaller Humanoid killed by the breath's damage, as well as every corpse of such a creatures within the cone, becomes a zombie (see the Monster Manual) under the dragon's control. The zombie acts on the dragon's initiative but immediately after the dragon's turn. Absent any other command, the zombie tries to kill any non-Undead creature it encounters.
