## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The hellion has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Soul Taker.** A Giant or a Humanoid that is reduced to 0 hit points by the hellion dies, and its soul rises as a lemure (see the Monster Manual) on Avernus, one of the Nine Hells, in {@dice 1d4} hours. If the creature isn't revived before then, it can be restored to life only by a wish spell spell or by killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature's original body.


## Actions

| Morningstar | +11 to hit | 3d8 + 7 damage) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10 damage) fire | - |
| Infernal Orb | DC 17 | 4d8 damage) fire damage and 18 (4d8 damage) necrotic | - |

**Multiattack.** The hellion makes two Morningstar attacks.

**Morningstar.** {@atk mw} +11 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}20 (3d8 + 7 damage) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10 damage) fire damage. If the target is a creature, it can't regain hit points until the start of the hellion's next turn.

**Infernal Orb.** The hellion hurls a magical ball of fire that explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the hellion can see within 120 feet of itself. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 18 (4d8 damage) fire damage and 18 (4d8 damage) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
