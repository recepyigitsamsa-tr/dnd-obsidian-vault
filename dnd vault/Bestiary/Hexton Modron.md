**Pincer.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}13 (2d8 + 4 damage) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6 damage) force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or have the incapacitated condition condition until the end of its next turn.

**Tentacle.** {@atk mw} +9 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}15 (2d10 + 4 damage) piercing damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the grappled condition condition (escape DC 14 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the hexton can't use this tentacle against other targets. The hexton has six tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

## Reactions

**Counter Magic.** The hexton attempts to interrupt a creature it can see that is casting a spell. If the spell is 3rd level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If the spell is 4th level or higher, the hexton makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 Saving Throw + the spell's level). On a success, the spell fails and has no effect.

**Lightning Rebuke.** When a creature within 120 feet of the hexton damages it, the hexton magically retaliates with an arc of lightning. The creature must make a DC 17 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10 damage) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
