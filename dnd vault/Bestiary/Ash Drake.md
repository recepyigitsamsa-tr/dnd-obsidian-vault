**Ash Cloud {@recharge}.** The ash drake beats its wings, filling the area within 10 feet of it with ash for 1 minute. The ash spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature that isn't an ash drake and that enters the cloud for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or become blinded condition until the end of its next turn. The ash moves with the drake, remaining centered on it for the duration.

**Ash Breath {@recharge 5}.** The ash drake spews blistering hot, choking ash in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6 damage) fire damage and is poisoned condition for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned condition. A poisoned condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
