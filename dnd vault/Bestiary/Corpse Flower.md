**Corpses.** When first encountered, a corpse flower contains the corpses of {@dice 1d6 + 3} humanoids. A corpse flower can hold the remains of up to nine dead humanoids. These remains have {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside the corpse flower. If the corpse flower dies, the corpses within it can be pulled free.

While it has at least one humanoid corpse in its body, the corpse flower can use a bonus action to do one of the following:

**Stench of Death.** Each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the corpse flower or one of its zombies must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, unless the creature is a construct or undead. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated condition until the end of the turn. Creatures that are immune to poison damage or the poisoned condition condition automatically succeed on this saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the stench of all corpse flowers for 24 hours.
