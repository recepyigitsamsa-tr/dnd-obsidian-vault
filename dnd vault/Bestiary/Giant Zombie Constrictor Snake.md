## Traits

**Sunlight Vulnerability.** While in sunlight, the snake has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on sight. When the snake begins its turn in sunlight, it immediately suffers 10 radiant damage.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the snake to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the snake drops to 1 hit point instead.
