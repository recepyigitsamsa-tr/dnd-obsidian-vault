## Traits

**Physical Restraint.** The dabus doesn't make melee attacks or opportunity attacks, even in self-defense.

**Symbol Speech.** A dabus communicates by creating illusory symbols and pictures that float in the air in front of itself and disappear a few seconds later. A creature that can see such a message can decipher it with a successful DC 10 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check (no action required).

**Multiattack.** The dabus makes two Flying Brick attacks.

**Flying Brick.** {@atk rs} +5 to hit to hit, range 90 ft., one target. {@h}7 (1d8 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage.

**Grasping Ground {@recharge}.** The dabus causes a 20-foot-square area of ground it can see within 60 feet of itself to sprout clutching appendages made of stone. Each creature of the dabus's choice in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8 damage) bludgeoning damage and have the grappled condition condition (escape DC 13 Saving Throw). While grappled condition in this way, the creature has the restrained condition condition. The appendages vanish after 1 minute or if the dabus's {@status concentration} ends (as if {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell).
