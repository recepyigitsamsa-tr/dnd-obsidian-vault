A swallowed creature has the blinded condition and restrained condition conditions, and it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside the hertilod. At the start of each of the hertilod's turns, each swallowed creature takes 13 (2d12 damage) poison damage from the poisonous secretion in the hertilod's gullet.

The hertilod's gullet can hold up to two creatures at a time. If the hertilod takes 40 damage or more on a single turn from a swallowed creature, the hertilod must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which lands in a space within 10 feet of the hertilod and has the prone condition condition.
