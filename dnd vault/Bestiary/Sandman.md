**Claw.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}11 (2d6 + 4 damage) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6 damage) psychic damage. Damage from this attack doesn't wake an unconscious condition creature, unless the unconscious condition creature is below half its hp maximum. If the sandman scores a critical hit, the target is cursed with the eye-closer's curse. While cursed, the creature is blinded condition until it finishes a long rest or until the curse is lifted by remove curse or similar magic.

**Encourage Dreams {@recharge 5}.** The sandman encourages powerful dreams in the minds of up to three unconscious condition creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 15 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw. On a failure, nightmares fill the target's mind, and the target takes 35 (10d6 damage) psychic damage, wakes from its sleep, and is frightened condition for 1 minute. On a success, pleasant dreams fill the target's mind, and the target regains 10 {@dice 3d6} hp and can choose to remain unconscious condition or awaken. A frightened condition target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Dreamer's Sand {@recharge 5}.** The sandman throws magical sand in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious condition for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or another creature uses an action to wake it.
