## Traits

**Keen Smell.** The temple cat has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on smell.

**Priestly Purr.** When a cleric or paladin who worships Bastet spends an hour preparing spells while a Bastet temple cat is within 5 feet of it, that spellcaster can choose two 1st-level spells and one 2nd-level spell that it is able to cast and imbue the temple cat with the spells. The spellcaster doesn't expend spell slots to imbue the cat in this way. The cat can be imbued with no more than three spells at a time. The cat can use the Spellcasting action to cast each spell once, requiring no material components. Once the spells are expended, the temple cat must finish a long rest before it can be imbued with spells again.

**Multiattack.** The temple cat makes one Bite attack and one Claws attack.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}6 (1d4 + 4 damage) piercing damage.

**Claws.** {@atk mw} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 (2d4 + 4 damage) slashing damage.

**Fascinating Purr.** The temple cat purrs loudly at a Humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it and that can hear it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or be charmed condition. While charmed condition by the temple cat, the target is incapacitated condition and must move on its turn toward the cat by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet of the cat and pet or hold it. The target doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the cat, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed condition target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the temple cat's Fascinating Purr for the next 24 hours. The temple cat has advantage on attack rolls against any creature petting or holding it.
