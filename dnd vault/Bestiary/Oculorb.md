**Multiattack.** The oculorb makes two Dreadful Contact attacks or four Eye Beam attacks.

**Dreadful Contact.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}14 (3d6 + 4 damage) psychic damage, or 25 (6d6 + 4 damage) psychic damage if the target has the frightened condition condition.

**Eye Beam.** {@atk rs} +8 to hit to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. {@h}14 (3d6 + 4 damage) psychic damage.

**Antipathic Flood {@recharge 5}.** The oculorb releases a wave of negative emotions, choosing one of the following options:

**Weeping Eyes.** The oculorb weeps, releasing a wave of crushing despair. Each creature within 30 feet of the oculorb must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature's speed is reduced to 0 feet until the end of the oculorb's next turn, and if the creature was {@status concentration||concentrating}, its {@status concentration} is broken.

**Withering Glare.** The oculorb's eyes unleash furious scarlet energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 (6d10 damage) necrotic damage and has the frightened condition condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened condition. A frightened condition creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

## Reactions

**Obsessive Rebuke.** When the oculorb is damaged by a creature it can see within 60 feet of itself, it forces the creature to make a DC 16 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes 10 (3d6 damage) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
