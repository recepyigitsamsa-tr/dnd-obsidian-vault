While charmed condition in this way, a creature is incapacitated condition as it is beset by hypnotic, illusory visions.

**Augment Physicality (1/Day).** For 1 minute, the veil keeper magically obscures it location, heightens its physical ability, and increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While the veil keeper is augmented, attack rolls against it have disadvantage, it is Large, and it makes Strength and Dexterity saving throws with advantage. If the veil keeper lacks the room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available. These augmentations end if the veil keeper is incapacitated condition.

**Change Shape (3/Day).** The veil keeper magically transforms to look and feel like a Medium Humanoid it has seen.

The veil keeper reverts to its true form if the veil keeper is reduced to 0 hit points or if the veil keeper uses an action to end the transformation.
