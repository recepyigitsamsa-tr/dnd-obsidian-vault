**Sensuous Grace.** The mirager moves with a flowing grace that Humanoids find appealing.

## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | DC 13 | - | - |
| Slam | +5 to hit | 2d6 + 3 damage) bludgeoning | - |
| Thirsting Kiss | +6 to hit | 4d8 + 4 damage) necrotic | - |
| Blow Kiss | DC 14 | 5d6 damage) psychic | - |

**Multiattack.** The mirager makes two Slam attacks. If both Slam attacks hit a Medium or smaller creature, the target is also grappled condition (escape DC 13 Saving Throw). The mirager can grapple only one creature at a time.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +5 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 (2d6 + 3 damage) bludgeoning damage.

**Thirsting Kiss.** {@atk ms} +6 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled condition by the mirager, incapacitated condition, or restrained condition. {@h}22 (4d8 + 4 damage) necrotic damage, and the mirager gains temporary hp equal to half that amount.

**Blow Kiss.** The mirager blows a kiss at a creature charmed condition by it. The target must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 17 (5d6 damage) psychic damage and is stunned condition until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and the charmed condition condition immediately ends on it.

**Illusory Appearance.** The mirager covers itself and anything it is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes it look like another creature of its general size and Humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the mirager takes a bonus action to end it or if the mirager dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the mirager could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching it would feel its rough, sand-like skin. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Saving Throw Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to discern that the mirager is disguised.
