## Traits

**Earth-Shaking Movement.** As a bonus action after moving at least 10 feet on the ground, the zaratan can send a shock wave through the ground in a 120-foot-radius circle centered on itself. That area becomes {@quickref difficult terrain||3} for 1 minute. Each creature on the ground that is {@status concentration||concentrating} must succeed on a DC 25 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or the creature's {@status concentration} is broken.

The shock wave deals 100 thunder damage to all structures in contact with the ground in the area. If a creature is near a structure that collapses, the creature might be buried; a creature within half the distance of the structure's height must make a DC 25 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 17 (5d6 damage) bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone condition, and is trapped in the rubble. A trapped creature is restrained condition, requiring a successful DC 20 Saving Throw Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check as an action to escape. Another creature within 5 feet of the buried creature can use its action to clear rubble and grant advantage on the check. If three creatures use their actions in this way, the check is an automatic success. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone condition or become trapped.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the zaratan fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Weapons.** The zaratan's weapon attacks are magical.

**Siege Monster.** The elemental deals double damage to objects and structures (included in Earth-Shaking Movement).
