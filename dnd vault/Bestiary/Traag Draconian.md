## Traits

**Blood Frenzy.** The draconian has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points.

**Controlled Fall.** If the draconian falls and isn't incapacitated condition, it subtracts up to 50 feet from the fall when calculating the fall's damage.

**Death Throes.** If the draconian is reduced to 0 hit points, its body erupts into sludge that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within that area must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or be covered in the sludge for 1 minute. While covered in the sludge, a creature's speed is halved. A creature can use its action to scrape the sludge off itself or another creature within 5 feet of itself.

| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Claw | +8 to hit | 2d8 + 5 damage) slashing | - |
| Flaming Carnage {@recharge 5} | DC 14 | 4d10 damage) fire | - |

**Multiattack.** The draconian makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}14 (2d8 + 5 damage) slashing damage.

**Flaming Carnage {@recharge 5}.** The draconian indulges its rage, wreathing itself in fire and moving up to its speed. The draconian can enter creatures' spaces during this move. During this movement, when the draconian enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC 14 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10 damage) fire damage and is knocked prone condition. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is pushed to the nearest space out of the draconian's path. A creature can be affected by this draconian's Flaming Carnage only once during a turn.

## Reactions

**Violent Retaliation.** If a creature within 10 feet of the draconian hits it with an attack, the draconian can make one Claw attack against that creature. If the Claw attack hits, it deals an additional 4 (1d8 damage) slashing damage.
