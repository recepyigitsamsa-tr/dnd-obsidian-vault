**Multiattack.** The thessalkraken makes one bite attack and two tentacle attacks. It can replace each tentacle attack with one use of Fling.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}20 (3d8 + 7 damage) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10 damage) acid damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature grappled condition by the thessalkraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded condition and restrained condition, it has {@quickref Cover||3||total cover} against attacks and other effects outside the thessalkraken, and it takes 21 (6d6 damage) acid damage at the start of each of the thessalkraken's turns.

If the thessalkraken takes 35 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, it must succeed on a DC 23 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone condition in a space within 10 feet of the thessalkraken. If the thessalkraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained condition by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone condition.

**Tentacle.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}17 (3d6 + 7 damage) slashing damage, and the target is grappled condition (escape DC 16 Saving Throw). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained condition. The thessalkraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Fling.** One Medium or smaller object held or creature grappled condition by the thessalkraken is thrown up to 40 feet in a random direction and knocked prone condition. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6 damage) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone condition.

**Acid Saliva {@recharge 5}.** The thessalkraken spits a glob of acid at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 18 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10 damage) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Legendary Actions

**Tentacle Attack.** The thessalkraken makes one tentacle attack.

**Fling.** The thessalkraken uses Fling.

**Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions).** While underwater, the thessalkraken expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the thessalkraken. Each creature other than the thessalkraken that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10 damage) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of the thessalkraken's next turn.
