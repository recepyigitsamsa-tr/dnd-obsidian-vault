**Mounted Adept.** While mounted and without the incapacitated condition condition, the rider has advantage on melee attack rolls against any unmounted creature smaller than its mount, the rider and its mount have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and the rider can force an attack targeted at its mount to target the rider instead.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the rider to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the rider drops to 1 hit point instead.
