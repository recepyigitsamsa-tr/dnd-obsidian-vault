**Possession {@recharge 5}.** One Humanoid that Caradoc can see within 5 feet of himself must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Charisma saving throw or be possessed by him; he then disappears, and the target is incapacitated condition and loses control of its body. Caradoc now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. Caradoc can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn Undead, and he retains his alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, immunity to being charmed condition and frightened condition, and his Divisive Whispers bonus action. He otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, Caradoc ends it as a bonus action, or he is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell spell. When the possession ends, Caradoc reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to Caradoc's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.
