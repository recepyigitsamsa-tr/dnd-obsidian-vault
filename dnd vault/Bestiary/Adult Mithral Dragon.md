**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The dragon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Mithral Scales.** If the dragon rolls a 20 on a saving throw against a spell that targets only it, the dragon is unaffected, and the spell is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the dragon, turning the caster into the target.

**Multiattack.** The dragon uses its Frightful Presence. It then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}17 (2d10 + 6 damage) piercing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the dragon can end one magical effect of its choice of 5th level or lower on the target.

**Claw.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 (2d6 + 6 damage) slashing damage, and if the target isn't a Construct or Undead, it must succeed on a DC 19 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or lose 7 {@dice 2d6} hp at the start of each of its turns as a piece of metallic claw breaks off in the wound. Any creature can take an action to remove the claw with a successful DC 14 Saving Throw Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check. The claw pops out of the wound if the target receives magical healing.

**Tail.** {@atk mw} +12 to hit to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}15 (2d8 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or become frightened condition for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Shard Breath {@recharge 5}.** The mithral dragon spits metallic shards in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6 damage) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute, then the shards dissolve into wisps of silvery smoke. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 7 (2d6 damage) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

## Legendary Actions

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a Tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 20 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6 damage) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone condition. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
