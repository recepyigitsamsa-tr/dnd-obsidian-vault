## Traits

**Bloodheart Stake.** The impaler is magically bound to the ceremonial stake and the sacrificed corpse the ritual caster used to create it. If the impaler is reduced to 0 hit points, it disappears, then re-forms {@dice 1d8} hours later in the nearest unoccupied space to the stake and regains all its hit points. The impaler dies only if it is reduced to 0 hit points while either the ceremonial stake is removed from the sacrifice's corpse or the impaler is on a different plane of existence from that corpse.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the impaler fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
