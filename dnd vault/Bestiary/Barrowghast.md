## Traits

**Stench.** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the barrowghast must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the poisoned condition condition for 1 minute. While poisoned condition this way, the creature can't regain hit points. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the Stench of all barrowghasts for 24 hours.


## Actions

| Action | Hit or Save | Damage | On Save |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiattack | - | - | - |
| Slam | +8 to hit | 2d12 + 5 damage) bludgeoning | - |

**Multiattack.** The barrowghast makes two Slam attacks. It can replace one Slam attack with a Life Drain attack.

**Slam.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}18 (2d12 + 5 damage) bludgeoning damage.

**Life Drain.** {@atk mw} +8 to hit to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. {@h}9 (1d8 + 5 damage) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Saving Throw Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

A Humanoid slain by this attack immediately rises as a zombie (see the Monster Manual). The zombie acts as an ally of the barrowghast but isn't under its control.

## Reactions

**Noxious Wound.** Immediately after the barrowghast takes piercing or slashing damage, poisonous ichor sprays from the wound. Each creature within 5 feet of the barrowghast must make a DC 16 Saving Throw Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6 damage) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
