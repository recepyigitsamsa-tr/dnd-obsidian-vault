**Warp Shadow.** The peryton chooses up to three creatures within 60 feet of it that it can see. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 Saving Throw Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. While cursed, whenever the creature makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, it must roll a {@dice d4} and subtract that number from the roll. A cursed creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this peryton's Warp Shadow for 24 hours.

**Dive Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The peryton moves up to its speed toward one target of its choosing. It then makes a gore attack that deals an extra 9 (2d8 damage) piercing damage on a hit.
