**Swamp Claw.** {@atk mw} +7 to hit to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 (1d6 + 5 damage) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Saving Throw Strength saving throw or become engulfed by the groff. While engulfed, the target can't breathe, is restrained condition, and takes 10 (3d6 damage) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. When the groff moves, the engulfed target moves with it.

An engulfed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns. On a success, the target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied space.
