## Traits

**Green Regeneration.** While in a forest, the vine lord regains 10 hp at the start of its turn if it hast at least 1 hp.

**Magic Resistance.** The vine lord has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Root Mind.** The vine lord and the tendril puppets it has created are connected via a hive mind. The vine lord and its puppets can telepathically communicate with each other, provided the communicating creatures are within 1 mile of each other. In addition, while in a forest, the vine lord can't be surprised.

**Vine Seed.** A creature infected with a vine lord's vine seed suffers near-constant pain as the seed takes root and spreads tendrils throughout its body. For the first 24 hours after infection, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, as the pain from the spreading roots distracts it. Then, the seed becomes a disease, devouring the creature from the inside as it grows vines throughout the creature's body. Until the disease is cured, the infected creature can't regain hp, and its hp maximum decreases by 7 ({@dice 2d6}) for every 24 hours that elapse. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if this disease reduces its hp maximum to 0.

This potent disease can be cured only by the greater restoration spell spell or similar magic. Alternatively, a creature can take 10 minutes and remove the growing seed from the infected creature within the first 24 hours of infection by succeeding on a DC 16 Saving Throw Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check. A Humanoid slain by this disease rises 24 hours later as a tendril puppet under the vine lord's control.

**Woodland Walk.** Difficult terrain composed of plants doesn't cost the vine lord extra movement. In addition, it can pass through plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
